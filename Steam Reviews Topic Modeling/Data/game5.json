With X-Com you except quick gameplay, bombastic explosions and powers\u2026 PP is much more subdued matching it\u2019s nihilistic world.\n\nA huge plus point for this game is how accuracy is handled with visual circles rather than percentages. That and how the bullets are \u201cphysically\u201d in the world leaving you with this tangible feeling of ballistic combat (rather than an animation playing saying you hit or miss).\n\nMy one criticism would be the music during combat encounters.

And fix anything that doesn't make the slightest bit of sense?\n\nDon't.  Buy.  It.\nDon't.  Play.  It.\n\nIt's not that the game CAN'T be good.  It COULD!  And that just makes it worse.\nAt some point, over the years that they've been working on this... they actually had to put EFFORT into not communicating.\n\nHonestly?  It feels like a group of Engineers that decided to make a complicated machine together.  So they all took their individual parts of it, designed them in separate rooms over a period of months... but never really talked about the details.\n\nAfter my most recent play, I finally just had to exit and walk away, muttering to myself 'Gimmicks are not a substitute for gameplay... Gimmicks are not a substitute for gameplay....' while I uninstalled it.\n\nThis is now the third time I've uninstalled it.\nNot only have the most fundamental complaints NOT been addressed, but the team has added MORE things for the alien invaders to do that make less than no sense, even inside of the lore.\n\nI'm gonna just give ONE example:\n\nOne of the new armored Sirens casts Enrage on their proximity.  The other armored Siren now can move absurdly far across the screen, and promptly does so.  It then casts a 100% hit Mind Control on any one of your characters, AND has plenty of movement to spare.  This will cost the Siren a couple of Will Points per turn.... good thing they have a bank of something absurd like 60, right??\n\nAlright.  Cool.  This happens a LOT.\n\nYour mind-controlled dude then runs over and uses his med-pack on one of those Sirens.\n....except.... those med packs don't WORK on the aliens.  But he's mind-controlled.  So... now they do.\n\nOr, maybe he got poisoned before being mind-controlled.  That's another one of those 100% success enemy abilities.  Bet you wish you had one of those, eh?  Only if you have more Will Points then them.  Hint:  You won't.\n\nNow that he's on their side, he'll run away, sit in a corner, heal himself, and act completely opposite to what mind-controlling-your-enemy-during-an-active-firefight would accomplish.  While he's sitting in that corner pumping himself full of stimpacks, your turret blasts him to bit.\n\nBecause mind-control, right?  How the HELL would a turret know that...?\n\nBut, you've got other teammates.  So you run forward, and blast him with your assault rifle.  Cool!  A good hit.  The alien is now... half-dead.  Unless it's a Siren, then they just look at you blankly, clearly asking for more punishment.  That same alien takes an identical assault rifle, and shoots you BACK with it.  You, of course, stand there and take it.  Because mind-control?  Nope... that's just what you do.\n\nSo you think to yourself:  Wow, I really need some better armor!  Or to get myself some more hitpoints.  Because one hit and I'm utterly spent, usually crippled, and don't really have alternatives.\n\nExcept you don't get that new shiny armor.  There's starting Tier 1 armor, DLC/Quest armor, and Tier 2 late-game stuff.  Aliens, though?  Oh maaaannnn they go through 35 iterations of armor and weapon combos.\n\nSo... now it's a slug-fest.  Whomever shoots first, wins.  They get better armor, better weapons, more variety, more tech, and most importantly, more units.  Not only more units, but they are completely and utterly unaffected when their units die.\n\nThose aren't even bugs.  That's intentional.\n\nOh?  Did I mention this slug-fest is happening on a base defense mission?  Sorry, forgot that part.  What is base defense?\nIt's where you go to a base, and do everything except close the door, deploy defenses, or do anything 'defensive'.  Rather it's a fight that happens to occur in a 'base' tileset, with random stuff strewn about like monkeys got it and trashed the place.\n\nAnd that's the feeling, over and over again.\nA disjointed mess where nobody ACTUALLY sat down and made sure that it flowed, played right, was balanced, or otherwise even necessarily made sense in the lore they're setting down.\n\n...it's like they NEVER even GOT to that phase where they might adjust something small that's a bit OP.  They never even got to the OP discussion.  You almost have to wonder if any of them have actually played the game from the player-standpoint, or if their experience is purely design.\n\nBethesda gets away with it, because mods.  They leave the door open for players to fix their legendary mess.\nSnapshot Games apparently doesn't even believe in leaving THAT door open.\n\nAnd that?  That's just a single battle example.

Some things I really like are the manual aiming/body parts, traversible world map Geoscape, and scavenging for resources parts of the game, they add a lot.\n\nHowever, the game's maps all feel the same which gets very bland. There are basically a half dozen maps with debris and cover generated randomly but it gets old and recognizable much faster than in X-Com.\n\nSecondly, it takes way too long to get access to the elite classes. This lack of variety is exacerbated with the multiclassing; sounds cool and in theory adds diversity, but with only 3 options just makes most of your troops feel the same.\n\nThird is lack of enemy variety. They're either the same as your troops if human or one of just a small handful of creatures. While they do evolve and gain more appendages or different heads, they also get repetitive and take a long time to get to enemies that aren't simply armored melee units or aliens with human guns.\n\nI do really like Phoenix Point but the lack of diversity does make the game start to feel bland right as it should be hitting its stride; adding meaningful map diversity, enemy diversity, easier access to elite units and more unique personnal quirks would really help make Phoenix Point the game that it should be.

Repetitive missions, broken mechanics, unfair status effects, same-y enemies, obtuse strategic layer, characterless soldiers, too much trial and error, it goes on and on.\n\nThe only redeeming factor is the manual aim system, which is novel and could've helped to differentiate the game from other games like it, though I'm not sure if I really prefer it over chance-to-hit based systems.\n\nEven the narrative doesn't really make sense. The game seems to push you towards stealing from factions (it doesn't exactly fit for phoenix point, the supposed saviors of humanity, to resort to banditry) and eventually having them fight one another despite the fact that humanity is being systematically genocided. I also don't like Synedrion, as a communal anarchist utopian faction who wants to be friendly to the environment and combat all forms of discrimination feels a little out of place on an Earth which is already a wasteland by the time the game takes place. It feels like it's trying to be grimdark too hard which just harms the game in the end.\n\nI got it on sale, and it still feels like a waste of money.

I was an early backer and played that first launch where the game was an unbalanced, needlessly difficult and boring mess, but I vowed to give them time to fix it and try again.\nUnfortunately, no amount of patches and hot fixes are going to fix this games core, underlying issue:\nIt is slow. Dull. Boring. Uninteresting. It has no personality.\n\nNow, I'm not someone who needs a testosterone fuelled, explosion orgy in a whirlwind of death to enjoy a game. I play strategy games like Civilization, Stellaris, XCOM, Phantom Doctrine, King of Dragon's Pass, etc. But there is nothing in this game to get excited about or grip you. Even the music is this slow, constantly dragging, two tone snooze fest. I enter combat or go on a mission and have the exact same single music track as when I'm looking at the washed out 2D Base images or the dingy grey world map. The same dreary, monotonous music which literally sounds like a bored, depressed person halfheartedly playing an old piano for a boss they hate at a job they don't care about. Music sets the scene for media - it tells the audience how they should be feeling. Phoenix Point's music tells me I should be bored and depressed.\n\nCombat likewise seems to take an age. Maps are large and mobility is low, even when maxed out, and differs wildly between troops. The maps aren't particularly varied either and seem to either be open, sparse and poorly thought out or a poorly thought out maze of buildings and corners you have to creep through.\nEnemies die slowly. There's no sense of urgency and your tactical options are limited. In fact, the largest tactical option open to you is the free aim system, which allows you to selectively pick off body parts and take enemies apart piece by piece, which sounds like a great idea but again it just slows down what is already a fairly dragged out combat experience. You never feel like you've achieved anything when an enemy dies; they either meander towards you and die in a couple of shots, remain stationary and have to be ground down from a safe distance or take so long to wear down that it's relief when it's over and you can finally do something else.\n\nThe story and lore, which could have been this game's saving grace, is again halfhearted and often feels like an teenage armature writer's club trying to show off how cool and edgy and dark they are. It's lazy and self-indulgent, mixing in so many elements that I wonder if a lot of it didn't come from other ideas the writers had, which they just crow-barred into Phoenix Point because they were the only ones willing to hire them.\n\nAll of this makes Phoenix Point a game which is too simple and too complex in all the wrong places. It badly needs someone to strip out the story, speed up the combat, diversify the game in every area from aesthetics and music to game play and basically just pump some love and character into this game. There is a good game in here, but they need to rethink the core experience they're trying to offer. A slow, thoughtful game is all well and good but it can't be slow and thoughtful all.the.time. Especially when you're facing down a horde of monsters, or subduing a gargantuan mutant terror or defending your base or raiding another faction and in between doing these things the game and story needs to progress. There is potential in here, but the game needs to find another gear.\n\nAlso, \u00a346 for this game? lol, just no.", "timestamp_created": 1616846279, "timestamp_updated": 1616846596, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710553348064422607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "89092746": {"recommendationid": "89092746", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997919158", "num_games_owned": 1174, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 738, "last_played": 1616560718}, "language": "english", "review": "Phoenix Point (PP) plays okay like whitebread on mayonnaise but lacks the soul of a game that originates from its own creation. It fails to recreate its own growth on the branch that it originates from by trying too hard to be new but too similar to be fun. \n\nThe lore feels like it's treating you like a hero protagonist in a stephen king novel written by Jordan Peterson, never calling you commander but depending on you to survive against lobsters and thus giving you all its information and breaking the 4th wall at every turn to succeed. The things you do never feels earned or rewarded, combat feels less fun and after spending 12 hours and losing one person due to a misclick, it just feels wrong. Original oldXCOM had you field dozens of soldiers, and your attitude was, Drago, if he dies he dies. PP places failure and death on optional while the game slides more and more into the ocean of mediocrity. It could have been great as a Peter Molyneux Project. \n\nWhile combat atmosphere does better than XCOM by Firaxis, PP being more scary, dark, atmospheric and accurate while not relying on RNG but by giving you the full line of sight ability from each squad member to dictate individual shooting actions (when you have control). But due to certain perspective bugs of your squad's overwatch inability, and being unable to choose where/when to fire during overwatch, means you will see bullets hitting walls/trees when defending. This feeling of the game giving the ability to escape from RNG but failing to perform its function due to technical incompetence became really annoying and ended many feelings of a good combat turn.\n\nBeyond shooting and missing, the fear of danger quickly disappears early/mid game. Because PP overworld (geoscape) gives almost weekly reports (every 10-30 minutes) of creature mutation and stats as \"intel report\", but your imagination or even the game studio's imagination is never held up to par by being suspenseful to your next encounter. We're suppose to be doing research to find out WHY/WHAT is attacking us, but weekly reports of literal body/weapon stats and all gear the enemy aliens are holding is never hidden and always being spoiled per session. Like watching a sci fi channels but knowing every twist and turn, what is the point of playing if we know all the aliens already?\n\nWhat's does it in even worse is the mutations almost doesn't matter. There's these 4 legged humanoids, and one that has 2 more legs and a snake monster. This isn't deadspace, they don't evolve based on where you shoot them. Then RNG attachments get artificially assembled onto the bodies like a malfunctioning Toy Stories factory by adding things like shields, guns or melee scythes onto each humanoid and that is all there is, some of them shoots, some of them hide and shank you, but it really doesn't matter in the scheme of exploring the unknown since nothing unknown in a stereotypical alien shit done over a decade ago. \n\nThen there are the NPC factions that you can either ally or steal from, but it's difficult to create empathy or hatred when one's about fascism/biology-cybernetics, one's about religion/psy-magic and the last is a communist/eco-terrorists, they never grow socially or politically. but they all impact the dwindling supply of human population when they get attacked or tampered with, so if they all die, your game ends. The only three human factions left are so politically polarised and by not uniting to face a common growing threat, it just does not make sense and is never addressed beyond they are just different triangles trying to be circles.\n\nPS. There's mods on nexus but, mods can only change so many things, ideally tweaks and not bugs nor content.\n\nHonourable mentions of Firaxis XCOM, even the 2k XCOM, OldXCOM, Xenonauts and Phantom Doctrine for having some soul.

The world map is very large but the mission maps seemed smaller.  The world map is spherical and rotates which I found difficult to navigate.  Its hard to tell how far a path is when you can't see it all and it doesn't show the travel time.  Its also hard to see what has changed in the world when you can't see it all at once.  I would much prefer a flat map with some wraparound instead.   So it says I have 275 hours but my game time to win was only 21 hours.  Some of this is from just leaving it on all day but the majority is having to constantly restart missions because one of my dudes got wrecked from full health to death in one round.  This game has no downed state and your dudes die a lot.  It takes a lot of resources and game time to outfit a new soldier so you cannot accept much loss as resources are tight.  It only auto-saves before the start of each mission so if you don't save it yourself often you will have to repeat a lot of the missions.  The game works with both mouse and controller but it certainly is not optimized for controller.  A lot of the U/I navigation is just much quicker with the mouse.  There is a huge bug in the controls where the cursor randomly decides to home to the top corner of the map and gets stuck there and disables the controller.  You have to move the mouse to get things to work again.  There are a lot of times where the cursor stays on the wrong part of the map when you are moving between soldiers, if you are using the controller you have to move it all the way back but if you use the mouse it will jump to where it is supposed to be.  It locked up on me a couple of times and I had to kill the task to exit.  There was a big patch since I bought this, but it did not fix any of the issues I was having and broke some of the animation, especially deaths.

The geoscape elements are interesting at first, but feel under-developed and without much actual guidance for how you should proceed. My current game seems to be going well, but I couldn't tell you why, as I get the feeling I'm doing something wrong, and that the game will eventually punish me for it when it's already too late to change that.\n\nWhich leads to my other point; the balance is way off. Enemies in Phoenix Point become absurdly strong out of nowhere. I like difficult games, especially when they're strategy based, but the enemy factions will soon trounce you by a matter of attrition, when they have more action points than you could feasibly obtain.\nI'm sure you could Google the optimum way to play this game so that doesn't happen, but, that's dumb. I don't play strategy games to steal someone else's strategy. \nAt the start, this game feels way too easy, and then it's suddenly way too difficult; feeling cheap and unearned. There's no sense of the enemy factions advancing quicker than you. It's as if somebody flicks a switch and they're suddenly 4x more advanced than they were one in-game week ago.\nAt the time of this review, I am hoping to give the game more time and see if it improves, but, I was utterly hooked by XCOM 2 before my 9th hour of it, but by my 9th hour of Phoenix Point I'm not even sure if I can bring myself to finish it.\n\nA real shame, honestly.

Certain enemies have way too much armor/HP and \"I win\" abilities.

However it constantly leaves you confused or frustrated when it doesn't have to. Things feel different and changed only for the sake of difference and change. You get many choices that don't matter and then few or no choices when they would matter the most.\n\nIndividual perks, multiple classes and a dual class option... well that's great! But the first class is pre-selected for you and the perks are completely random, and are often irrelivant since a few missions would net you the same result. Hmm... alright tell me about second class? Well that is important... so good luck. Oh and we hid some of the class options, better jump through some hoops to see them. Now that that's done, the new options aren't very good.\n\nAlright I found some recruits and can fill my 6 soldier aircraft... but missions allow 8 soldiers, and very soon you need all you can bring. So now you need a bigger slower aircraft or multiple ones, but they vary in size and speed so now you are stuck organizing a time-distance multi vehicle carpool. Not exactly action packed gun blasting alien exploding combat.\n\nBetter give my soldiers pistols, pistols shoot bullets. Warning: 'Not proficient with weapon'. Ahh the majority of my soldiers doesn't know how to use a handgun.\n\nWe want the player to be on the offense and engage - so soldiers lose more stamina the longer missions go on! Great I get to play aggressive instead of an overwatch competition. Well... about that, see the enemies get stronger faster than your squad and there are more of them so you are at a considerable stat and action point disadvantage. Not to worry though, we put the most powerful action point leveler on the overwatch skill... so welcome back to the overwatch competition.\n\nMy soldiers are running low on stamina so I'll swap some out for fresh ones. Recruits are plentiful but base located, whereas equipment is global and takes time to be made, even with plenty resources. So now starts the ever tedious deequip and requip. Join this with your pre-selected soldiers... and your squad members pretty much become numbers.\n\nBase building is there, still for anyone capable of solving a 4 piece puzzle it is a non concern.\n\nThe tactical combat\nStep 1. Get full cover. Step 2. Fire from full cover. Step 3. Soldier steps completely out of full cover to ensure maximum enemy overwatch activation and return fire damage received.\n\nHaven defense. Ah, defenders advantage! Nope random spawns. You and faction soldiers spawn far away, enemies spawn at their objective. You can try hard offense and rush it... that load or restart button isn't there for decorative purposes.\n\nYour rifle won't dent a wall, your pistol one shots it, but only works on some walls and you don't get to know which. Other times you dash your squad for that line of sight to kill that crucial target... but the cruel forest monster and his many friends have set up quite a few indestructible walls of invisibility which block your bullets with magic.\n\nThis continues onward and you send your best squad half around the globe only to find out the mission was a dialog popup. You get better armor and defense against explosions, which is then bypassed by poison, and viruses, and there is fire, also acid, then all armor then gets nullified by armor penetration. So it's pretty much a full blown 'ADD' - Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock, Old MacDonald had a farm, Hey Macarena!\n\nSo it's strange. It has all the core ingredients, it's stable and with neat mechanics... yet comes out as a story of many good things that were or could have been, but are not now and can't be seen on the horizon, which I don't understand. The combination of current state + DLC's + console direction + no real workshop/mod/community unfortunately indicates the game will continue on a linear path towards simple and quite guided playthroughs, whereas I'd champion variety and replayability. And it appears even if they developer doesn't want to play around with such things, they seem to take steps so others can't either.

I've waited quite some time for this to be fixed, and still the problem persists. So I'm basically facing the sad truth, devs don't care about that problem, and any non QWERTY user be damned.

I love the genre, I really enjoyed my first 8 hours of it, but it just started to feel like a slog that became unfun.\n\n5/10\n\nPros:\n- Aim and fire: Taking out the right parts of enemies limits their effectiveness, adding a great amount of strategy\n- Diplomacy: Help the right people to get more tech/gear/etc\n- Trading: The ability to buy/sell supplies (and with careful checking, even making a profit moving stuff from one to another)\n- The differences between factions, they're really interesting and well thought out, all three have their own unique takes on survival and their own tech; and the android people can be considered a sort-of fourth faction\n- You feel like you're losing; you're up against an unbeatable enemy and really trying to survive/thrive\n- Ammo system - having to carry ammo is great, and limited inventory. The missions where you grab gear are quite interesting too\n- Mission variety - from attacking cities to defending them, to attacking pandora lairs to rescuing people; there is a great variety of interesting missions\n\nCons:\n- Story: 25 years after the virus hits the game starts, and you start with -nothing-. There are factions that manage to have global communication, and while it makes sense they don't work together, it's strange that they basically suck at existing.\n- Tech: Basic assault weaponry (but also rocket packs?) and basically useless armour. It's like taking army soldiers from now, but you forgot how to make shotguns or other basic gear of today, while having amazing vehicles. It's a weird juxtaposition of forgetting today's tech, but inventing a few less useful pieces. A lot of tech doesn't even tell you what you get, you just research things and hope you get something useful from it.\n- The Factions: To befriend them you have to babysit them. You're clearly just a small group of soldiers on a single airship yet they expect you to be everywhere and save all their cities. They have -lasers- and yet a few people with assault rifles are supposed to make this big difference? At least give me something for saving you, like some ammo for the laser guns I bought from you. What's more annoying is that as soon as you befriend them you get shown all their world conclaves and are expected to save them all, even if you're on the other side of the planet.  \n- Enemies: All the factions are rather unique, and fighting the three human factions is interesting. However the main enemy, the mist, basically just has everyone's abilities. You mostly fight the pandora, and it feels like fighting the humans is like fighting a weaker pandora. Especially once the pandora start generating unremoveable mist (except with explosives) in large areas around you, and cloaking every time they get hit while also healing when they shoot you. The pandora actually end up with better weapon tech before you do, and yet you can't steal the weapons back.\n- Cybernetics: Cybernetics are awesome, but apparently helping the androids means they automatically hate and want to murder you. Why aren't they just another faction like the other three?\n- The map: Everything is so spread out and you lack the resources early to easily outfit a single squad, no matter multiple. So you lose faction influence just for existing.\n- Aiming: Aiming is almost mandatory, as a lot of times you can fire at an enemy but have a 1% chance of hitting and as far as I could tell the game didn't tell you that unless you manually aim", "timestamp_created": 1615336670, "timestamp_updated": 1615336670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "88101926": {"recommendationid": "88101926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006082261", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 461, "last_played": 1615235763}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite Phoenix Point's legacy in Gollop's own design; it feels.. off. There are great systems, but they feel unbalanced against each other to the detriment of moment-to-moment gameplay. As such, and much in the same way as XCOM's own spin-off, Chimera Squad, the game leaves an impression of being a clone of something better: a shame, given the reality of the game's roots.\n\nThere is plenty of innovation to the developer's credit, but the combination of these systems falls short of what makes Firax's games so compelling. Many have put this down to the drab environments and weak customization elements. They are not wrong; a lack of connection to the world and your squad is one of the great successes of the XCOM series. However, the main problem with Phoenix Point is how loosely the individual systems fit together.\n\nDespite XCOM 2's RNG map design; most maps worked well with the characters, providing an experience that was both tight and open, with pod positions feeling crafted for either maximum challenge or maximum power-fantasy. No turn felt wasted. By contrast, Phoenix Point's few visually appealing maps are open shooting galleries, won only by attrition, with little scope for tactical flair. The least visually appealing maps, the \"mist\" areas, are drab corridor shooters, made worse by what seems like a good system on paper - the friendly fire mechanic.\n\nAnd this is really what sums up Phoenix Point; great ideas, but a failure to really understand why less is sometimes more. This leaves Phoenix Point feeling like less than the sum of its parts.\n\nReplacing RNG with a manual aim and specific body targeting does little to enhance gameplay due to the map design. The evolving enemies seem promising, but  enemies feel indistinct and unpredictable, which although counter-intuitive, is essential in a tactics game. Despite the increased action points, characters feel immobile, leaving the game feeling more like a cover shooter, rather than the refined, perceived-high-risk, plasma-infused game of chess that XCOM has become. \n\nI won't say much about the overworld; it feels well crafted - there is some additional complexity, but much of it feels like busy work, with little indication as to what is a priority and what isn't. The sense of relevancy may be there in subsequent playthroughs, but that doesn't help sell the game on the first run.\n\nTo summarize; if it were a board game, I would have created my own rules after the first game and then found great enjoyment in it; let's hope future workshop support or updates makes this the case. Do I dislike it? No. Do I feel like it has the potential to be better than XCOM? Sure. Will I be playing more? With the workshop support for XCOM, probably not anytime soon. Would I recommend it? On sale, yes. Am I being harsh?

First Playthrough, XCOM and Xenonauts Veteran, all good. I love the Overwatch mechanics and rely on it pretty heavily. Playing it safe. Lost no soldier so far *tap on shoulder* and eager to keep it that way.\nIn the lair though... Jesus. The Devs really did a great job here with level design. So I do my usual business, planning out a route to take through the rocky maze, search&destroy the objective, setting up overwatches and anticipating those creepy fishmen to poke around the wrong - or right - corners. Jokes on me!\nThe angles in this stupid lair were so... alien - literally - that they were jumping all over their supid stalagnites, taking podshots at me and retreating behind a solid wall with no easy way for me to retaliate... And I loved that. It's their home after all, they should have the upper hand, right?\nSo change of tactics, more rush, got the lair, all good. First mission to have all but one of my six soldiers injured, a couple even seriously hurting.\n\nWhy am I writing this? Because I feel like people are not giving Phoenix Point the credit it deserves. You get a lot of bad feedback on google that is some years old, and people still complain in this comment section that the game is not as far as it should be so long after its first release. I take a look at this game now - with fresh eyes - and I see a solid game. I don't see the balance mess it might have went through. And I think it's important to judge the game in the state it is in now and not how it came here.\n\nPlus I can't really relate to much of the bad feedback I've read about:\nI don't feel my troopers are cannonfodder or oneshots. As I said, I haven't lost anyone yet. But I also try to give them 20 strength asap - totaling to 200HP. Maybe I haven't encountered the one-shot enemies yet though. I don't know. The biggest thing I came across was a Chiron so far. And they are... annoying, but far from deadly - on their own.\n\nI don't think there are too many ambushes or missions. If you don't want missions, what do you play the game for anyway? Skip to Outro? And besides the tutorial does tell you that there will be much to handle and you can't possibly be everywhere. So feel free to let that haven decide its own fate.\n\nTutorial - another curator mentioned that the game is really sparse on info? Cannot relate. While the little intro story arc is great and puts a lot of info up front, basically everything new is explained to you as soon as you encounter it in the open.\n\nMuch to do. That's right. Especially with all the DLCs enabled I feel there is a lot of front-loaded content and I did feel a little overwhelmed on what to do. And what matters and what is just fluff. Getting a second and even third team asap is probably mandatory. Have them do the explore and haven defense missions, while your Alpha team does the quest and nest missions.\n\nReddit super-soldier guides? The game being punishing on \"casuals\"? I don't know about this. I am for certain not a casual, but I haven't read on guides or anything (besides of weapon stats in the wiki) to keep afloat. I'm not even multiclassing much, because often I feel those 50XP are better spent on the base stats than just a second class.\nMy A-Team is rocking 4 assaults with the ARES-AR1 (standard) assault rifle and an Odin (standard) grenade\n1 heavy with a Deceptor MG, the Neurazer for stunning and an Odin grenade\n1 sniper with a Pythagoras VII Laser sniper rifle and the CYPHER standard pistol\nThrow in a medkit and a spare magazine for everyone and you are good enough to go. Only multiclass is one Assault/Sniper. I'm pretty damn sure this is far from any Terminator meta build. It is possible is all I say.\n\nBut I don't want to sound like too much of a fanboy. There is of course downsides.\n\nThe \"strategic\" UI - especially for manufacturing - is a mess. Lots of scrolling, little quality of life. I would much prefer to have all your active ships with shortcuts on the side instead of having to iterate through them. Hell, I play the geoscape on \"slow\" because I lose track of what's happening otherwise. With just 3 Manticores (planes). \n\nFrom time to time the game stutters. It's probably bugged, because it doesn't always happen with the obvious elephant in the room (like a mist sentinel covering half the map in fog), but often when coming out of the Free Aim or after throwing grenades... But since this is a turn based game I don't have much issues with this. Let it lag out a couple seconds and you're good to go. If not, then most likely after your next shot it's good again.\n\nThe game somehow makes you feel bad. Kind of. For example I am on 6 bases now, meaning 12 plane and 12 vehicle capacity. But I only have 3/12 planes and 2/12 vehicles. Which at the start made me think I am progressing way too slow. But lacking the materials there's really nothing you can do about it.\nThe actual truth is: Less is more. You will probably have a lot of spare capacities and building slots at all of your bases. Feel free to even demolish excess stores or facilites you won't be using. The materials are better spent elsewhere. And that's the premise of the game I feel: You are scratching together a last line of defense. You are not dominating a virus.\n\nLack of progression. That's kind of true. You don't progress upwards much. There's no better weapons. Just different weapons. You progress wide, though. Up that one 4-man team to a 6-man and two 3-man/1-car teams and you know that you made progress. Starting to cover the area with scans (which are by the way another materials trap!!! You don't need them everywhere) and mist repellants also does feel like establishing a foothold. But not really progression.\nLore-wise I try to explain this with the timescale. You are dealing in hours in Phoenix Point, other than in XCOM or Xenonauts where you deal in days and months. Of course you won't make technological leaps in that timeframe, but rather finding something different to more suit your needs - for example the Synedrion laser sniper rifles.\n\nJust think about it. There are 60+ People STARVING per day in each haven because Pandoravirus makes agriculture and scavanging almost impossible. That should give you a good idea of what state humanity really is in. The game could maybe do a better job at setting the stage, but once I realized this for myself almost all of the aspects of the game made much more sense to me.\n\nTL;DR\nPhoenix Point is an uphill battle.

Some of the mechanisms are similar, if not the same, but Phoenix Point throws in it's own mix of features that separate it from the \"original inspiration\". \n\nThe graphics and sound are clear and precise, so certainly don't distract from the game, but they do not add any wow factor either. \n\nThe wide range of classes available for your troops, as well as both the genetic and cybernetic enhancements, give you plenty of scope to play, although you will soon find you end up with squads with the same mix of skills and abilities, as some combinations just don't work. \n\nThe political turmoil you find yourself in, with the 3 other factions, adds an extra dimension to your play. Do you make friends with all, just a few, or none at all? What technology the factions possess goes some way towards helping you decide. Do you get some specific tech quickly by stealing it as the risk of having that faction dislike you to the point of war, or do you build up trust and friendship to gain access to all their tech at a much slower rate?\n\nWith the wide range of enemy types, that updated technology is a must. Your starting weaponry is good enough for the initial aliens, and the occasional bandit, but when the Siren's appear on the scene, you best have something a lot better. Those can wipe out an unprepared squad quite quickly.\n\nThere are a few bugs that can be annoying. The main one being that some \"once per turn\" abilities can indicate they have been used when in fact they haven't. When that happens, you just have to spend the turn keeping your troops out of trouble.\n\nAll in all, this is a great game with plenty of scope for doing your own thing.

The game feels too long, for one. 80+ hours for the main campaign, I'm not sure I was anywhere under that for XCOM2, but I was really starting to feel it by the end in Phoenix Point.\nThe good :\n- Targeting system is original, and works well (although it is annoying you keep getting shot in the head, though)\n- Tactical combat feels good and interesting. All the basics are there, plus a couple new things (see above) that are welcome.\n- Enemies are nice. There are only around 5 or 6 main enemy types, but with mutations they feel very different, and evolve nicely as you progress in the game\n- Factions relations are interesting, especially as you get nice techs from them.\n- Devs seems pretty active fixing stuff, adding content, etc. \n\nThe not so good :\n- Missions are very repetitive...\n- Weapon progression is boring. When I got a new gun (through factions or research), I always feel excited and build one ASAP to try it out in the field. But usually, they don' t make much difference. The assault rifle from NJ or Synedrion have like 10 damage difference... One has a little more range, the other more damage, but really, they're the same. Then you get an improved AR, and it does a touch more damage with a sprinkle of piercing... Sure, it's better, but it doesn't feel worth the time researching it...\n- Weapons again, but a bit different : Explosive are useless past the very beginning of the game. You'd expect a grenade to pack more punch than an assault rifle. It really doesn't. The only point to the grenade launchers is that they can lob grenades and shoot over walls. But really if you can get a direct shot with a rifle, it gets way more efficient.\n- Last point on weapons : additional effects (poison, fire, etc.) feels useless. Virus is good, but I think that's the only effect I actually used other than because I thought \"hey, my soldier is equipped with it, let's use it, maybe it will this time prove better than just shooting the guy\".\n- Too many soldiers. Managing 3 different crafts by end game with three teams of soldiers, you sorta get lost in who's where doing what... And that's not counting the empty crafts exploring and pumping ancient artefacts.\n- Skills are boring too... Especially high level. I don't think I used most of the high level skills of my soldiers. Some lower level I used all the time. But too few.\n- Difficulty : Maybe I got used to tactical combat games and got real good (also, not afraid to load a game when I lose a soldier), but I played on Veteran, and didn't lose one soldier (never loading more than once, when in XCOM I would sometimes have to save scum a bit to keep my squad alive...), got 100% with all factions, didn't lose even half of the world population... Tactical combat is pretty balanced, I'd say, but the overall world mission is too easy. Steal a craft from a faction ?\n\nOverall, I liked the game. I'm really in love with tactical combat games, at the moment, and Phoenix Point is a great example. But there is a load of little things that could have made it better, less boring. I played Firaxis' XCOM2 3 times. Not sure I'll replay this one.

In essence, you freely direct a camera representing the selected character's POV, zooming in and out and panning around until you find something you want to shoot at. The 'accuracy' of the weapon you are firing is represented by a circle (which scales as you zoom) within which all your shots will land in - the smaller the circle, the more accurate your weapon. Cover is just whatever blocks you or your target from view - your units will duck / flatten themselves against what is nominally highlighted as 'low' and 'high' cover but really the important thing is what proportion of your character's body is hidden behind something that can't be shot through.\n\nWith this free aim system and individual hit location effects, combat becomes about surgically disabling enemy weapon systems, targeting unarmoured limbs, and finding shooting angles that keep you as little exposed as possible. The enemies develop stronger and stronger armour as the game progresses but, by finding each enemy's weak points, carefully thinking about the order your units attack in (some weapons penetrate armour, some don't penetrate armour but shred it, some don't do much damage but can stun enemies, etc, etc) and using a small handful of special abilities that higher level characters get, defeating them always feels like a mini puzzle game rather than an RNG dice throw. \n\nIt does feel like this base system could be built on much further but, as the first game (that I know of anyway) to use this sort of system, it's a great new way to approach turn-based tactical combat that feels fun and satisfying. \n\nLikewise, the pseudo-Lovecraftian lore and way it combines - eerily, given 2020 - mass pandemics and climate change into a horror-survival narrative also feels like a fresh take on a familiar theme... though equally somewhat under-utilised. There are some nice world building text descriptions during 'random encounters' on the strategic-level map but a few more details that supported world-building in the tactical maps would have been welcome.\n\nThe main problem with PP is that, with all love for the game, it does become pretty boring during its longish midgame. There aren't enough variety of enemies (the much vaunted 'adapting enemies' means not much more than sometimes the same basic enemy will have a grenade launcher and sometimes they won't) or of biomes / map types or of mission varieties so that, by the midgame, you've seen nearly (nearly...) everything the game has to offer.\n\nAdded to this, the minimalist soundtrack, while brilliantly atmospheric at times, is generally so minimalist that you're often playing in near silence and a limited palette of customisation options and little ability to give your units personality meant I was never as invested in individual characters as I was in, say, the later XCom games. \n\nFinally, on the negatives, while the tactical game is great, the strategic layer is very minimal, 'diplomacy' not worthy of the name, and - most of a problem for me - there just wasn't enough character or narrative to keep me hooked. There are few NPCs to provide emotional content and a very thin overarching story that doesn't have enough dramatic hooks to keep you invested in a story. \n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a game with a story that will keep you captivated (such as Banner Saga) or on the edge of your seat (such as XCom 2 et al) or involved strategic or diplomatic gameplay, then I think you'd be disappointed in PP. However, if you think you'll be satisfied with a solid tactical turn-based game with some light strategy elements and a focus on innovative, if not earth shattering, combat mechanic then I reckon you'll be happy enough.", "timestamp_created": 1613328261, "timestamp_updated": 1613328261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612438857555389404", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "86641134": {"recommendationid": "86641134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061206633", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1103, "last_played": 1614565182}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely an XCOM game.

If if you can do some of those your going to be way behind - attacks will be happening all over the place and you wont have the teams to fight them because you have based to detect the attacks or you will have the teams but you wont have the bases so your will never know about them.   Maybe your lucky and you have 2/3 and your sending teams out with no gear.\n\nThe game could easily be made much better if you bases could produce resource or gear on their own for little or no cost .\n\n\nSoldiers are both treated as complete cannon fodder if you didn't min /max and make some cheezy exploit character class that a few soldiers might be OP but they can also be 1 -2 shot to instant death at anytime .\nSoldiers and gear are super expensive but they are also fodder and can easily die .  Materials are also super limited which leads to a bad combination.\n\nITs a few steps away from being a better game then xcom - but right now its worse then most things in the genre from some glaring flaws - its a fun interesting game early on for the first 6-8 hours and worth while , once the enemy starts to really expand the mist the games becomes an repetative drag  or a slow painful death against enemies your a not ready to handle.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin  for me is EVEN if you do things flawlessly follow guides ,get a great start you end up with highly level team well equipped , you will hit a point where the enemies become so strong only your best Min/ Maxed guys can win fights - when 2-3 fights are going on the same time in the world with over powered enemies you don't have the resources to take them all out and the imbalance is frustrating and annoying \n\nThe game has made great strides but its just not there yet.", "timestamp_created": 1613282584, "timestamp_updated": 1613282584, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718820691108703613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "86601276": {"recommendationid": "86601276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025284793", "num_games_owned": 478, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3929, "last_played": 1613757802}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Very X-COM Like, but not X-COM[/h1]\nThis is for the Year One Edition. So it means reviewing the game with the DLC and all the patches and improvements. Unsurprisingly the game has a lot of X-COM feel. but there are some key differences. It's possible you won't feel as invested in the game as with X-COM and I'll touch on the why's of that a few times. \n\nI do recommend it, but there are reasons why you might still be disappointed. So do the \"reading all the words\" thing if part of what you liked about X-COM was really making your team super and you actually felt your individual soldiers had personalities and you really loved the story. \n\nOn the other hand if the X-COM combat felt a bit tedious at times or formulaic or you found there was a certain soldier class you just wished could do a little bit more, PP fixes that. If you wanted a different type of geoscape/base building meta. If you thought X-COM didn't always feel grand enough, you too might want to read all the words.\n\n[b]How it's different from X-Com[/b]\nPheonix point pushes you to not care about your soldiers as much. It provides mechanisms that allow you replace them faster and more readily. It pushes you to develop multiple teams. This is still a tough thing for me since I don't like losing soldiers and I don't like save scumming so when you get a bad mission draw and things happen that you have very little chance to avoid that get soldiers killed it frustrates me a lot even though I know it likely won't really stop me from progressing. It's not a bad mechanic, if you embrace it I can see how it makes the game feel like a more desperate fight. But this is a hard point for me and I can see how it would make you like the game less even you don't really get why. \n\n[b]All Your Bases Are Belong to Us[/b]\nLots of bases, and you'll need them. You don't need to develop them all, but with how scanning works in the current version (it's automatic and \"constant\" once you have the facilities compared to having to manually trigger them in earlier versions) you do need to active a few bases. So it's a very different Geoscape meta from X-COM. I'm OK with this, I just wish that controller navigation worked better. I just have too many issues with not realizing I have a aircraft selected when I'm going to check out a base and since they don't just give specific buttons to the actions when you have a base selected I can accidentally redirect a flight to a base when I was just intending to inspect it to start a repair/upgrade. This isn't really an issue with KB/mouse. But I actually prefer the controller for the combat. I'm odd.\n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nYou have more actions in Pheonix point, that alone gives more flexibility. You still have the issue where range is way more important than accuracy, but the free aim does help a little with this. There are still times where your full aim circle is completely within the target and you still miss, but it's not as common as a 99% hit chance missing in X-COM once you are used to it. [b]I certainly like combat better in Pheonix Point than X-COM[/b] This is also aided by smaller maps quicker engagement speed, less need to hunt for that one last jerk of an alien. But as mentioned everything is more fragile in PP compared to X-Com. You and the enemy both, even the big armored enemies you face will go down faster, sometimes because of the teamwork you can bring to focus on them more readily. All of your soldiers have more flexibility than in X-COM so it easier to adapt to most situations. Though you do still run into issues where you just get flattened and you don't really have much chance to respond.\n\n[b]You aren't meant to save everyone[/b]\nYou can, but the way things work they want you to side with just one, maybe two, of the three factions and then you the other as your punching bag to get the various resources you need or want. It really is a lot simpler to just raid one of the factions for a vehicle or tech or food or supplies than just about anything else at certain stages of the game.\n\n[b]Healing is weird[/b]\nYour broken limbs heal instantly after battle, but your HP need a medical center. Your stamina is supposed to matter but it doesn't matter until you get to a really a low break point. So this does lead to some situations where you hang around at the end of missions using medpacks to heal the HP damage on everyone so that you can have that team in action again much faster because the fact that one soldier had both legs and arm and their head disable doesn't matter, you can go fight an Pandoran incursion 30 minutes later and she's all good. The mechanics are in place to make it much more interesting, and with how they push you to not care as much about soldiers and develop more of them the missed some opportunities. The simplest for me would be that having a limb disabled is a stamina hit. You have 40 and it really doesn't matter until you get under 10 and a mission only takes like 2 most of the time. So if you lost 5 for a disabled limb then yeah the BS stuff would suck, but it still doesn't stop you from rapid deployments unless your getting disabled a lot. So flying back to a base and just dropping that soldier off to recover and grabbing another would be another strategy layer to add.\n\n[h1]If you like X-COM you'll probably like PP[/h1]\nThere is more combat, it will be with more squads, this will force you to learn new tactics because you just won't have your A-Team all the time. This will actually make you enjoy things more and make you more effective. You may get tired of it, you may realize that certain mission types just annoy you with risk reward and you'll skip them. But in it's current state, that's OK because there is always something to do for most of the game. You may feel more disconnected from the game than you did with X-COM. The story is not delivered as forcefully, you don't get as invested in your troops. You might get annoyed with how black and white all three factions see things when you sit there seeing all the obvious ways that at least any 2 of them could combine and make even more awesome stuff, admittedly it's hard to see how all three could coexist.\n", "timestamp_created": 1613281018, "timestamp_updated": 1613281018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504950463771820068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "86593365": {"recommendationid": "86593365", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992136091", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4328, "last_played": 1617588922}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent Game.

In general, this is a fun game and you can sink a lot of hours into it and enjoy yourself.\n\nHowever, if you're coming over from modern Xcom you need to know a few things. They have the same framework but their mechanics are very different at times. Cover really only acts to conceal your soldiers from gunfire by making them bigger or smaller targets. You don't have a % chance to  miss a shot, you have general odds of EACH ROUND going into a specific zone and if one or multiple enemies (or allies) are in that zone they are at risk of getting hit. Free aiming is newly implemented and let's you pick off certain body parts or weapons (very cool and useful). You also get to pick which lanes your soldiers overwatch, which is extremely helpful, but the enemy will take notice and attempt to thwart you through movement. Also, make sure you don't set yourself up so an enemy can pull overwatch through one of your own soldiers (a hilarious fuck up that will cost you a soldier to friendly fire.)\n\nThis game lacks certain quality of life features. Examples: your soldiers use action points (AP), which are represented by a bar made up of 4 slivers (each is an AP). The game gives you general information about how much AP will be used moving a character or performing certain actions but there are times (infuriating times) where your character will be left with what looks like 1 AP, which is sometimes all you want or need, but in reality you actually have just a teensy bit less than 1 AP (which generally leaves your character dead,\n\nThe overworld HUD will draw your attention to, audibly alert you to, and constantly mark faction havens that are under attack. You will not be alerted in a similar manner when your own bases are threatened. You instead receive a silent text alert in the top right corner of the HUD that you can click on. This cost me several bases.\n\nYou will need to remember the names and locations of your bases because the game does not do a great job of easily making it known which bases are where and what resources you are sending to which parts of the world. This caused me to many times back out of what I wanted to do and click around until I found the base, briefly memorized the name, and then clicked back into what I was doing.\n\nWhen a friendly faction comes under attack you will see two numbers: Attacking strength and defending strength. As far as I can tell, these numbers only mean something if you're going to let the battle autoresolve because you might think that a defending strength of 11 to attacking strength of 3 means you're going to have significant ally support. You'd be wrong. You might have 3 allies on the map and sometimes they will just plain skip their turn and get massacred. Do not rely on them.\n\nRemember how pissed you were when one of your soldiers got mind controlled? Brace yourself because certain enemies can mind control multiple characters (they will then smartly hide so that you cannot break the mind control easily). In short, enemy mind control rocks, yours does not. \n\nDo not expect the constant feeling of progression in technology that you got from Xcom. The weapons you can get pretty early will pretty much be what takes you through the game. I found the other weapons to be more lateral moves than upward ones.

The realistic ballistic model they talk about in their promotions is no joke, and the free aim system is remarkable. This is not to say it is without fault, on rare occasions shots that seemed to have a 100% chance to hit ended up missing, and non standard projectiles like grenades are much more likely to hit something stupid on their path. Given that, this system is far superior to % hit chances. When I make a shot in Phoenix Point I am much more aware of the odds. If I have a sniper at point blank range, there is a 100% chance that I can hit not only the enemy, but the specific body part I need to disable for my guy to live. My favorite part is how this works with the destructible terrain. I can spot an enemy on the other side of the wall, then blow up the wall to make the shot. better still, I can use a high powered cannon or sniper to go through both wall and enemy, or multiple enemies. \n      My second favorite thing has to be the 4AP/turn with partial AP mechanic allowing your soldiers (and  the enemy) to do much more intelligent moves. For example, take a step out of cover, use 3AP to shoot, move back with the other half of the first AP. Or use a full AP to move into the open, 2AP to shoot, then the last to continue moving forward towards the enemy. The downsides here are that Heavies will not lift their weapons over obstacles so them having the ability to jet pack to roofs is kind of dumb if they cant shoot at people below them. \nCross classing/ class diversity: The sh*t\nvehicles: sh*t\nWeapon diversity: The Sh*t\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1612883313, "timestamp_updated": 1612883313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "86275130": {"recommendationid": "86275130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141088827", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 28333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1462, "playtime_at_review": 18217, "last_played": 1619095414}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, one that will be keeping me entertained for many many play-throughs.", "timestamp_created": 1612882973, "timestamp_updated": 1612882973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "86251499": {"recommendationid": "86251499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074334293", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1972, "last_played": 1612786692}, "language": "english", "review": "this game make my life much more harder", "timestamp_created": 1612852767, "timestamp_updated": 1612852767, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461982667446136475", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "86217846": {"recommendationid": "86217846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140129580", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3541, "last_played": 1613081774}, "language": "english", "review": "PROS\nPhoenix Point is a quality tactical management game allowing you to make decision about basic resourcing and tactical control of the battle field. There are a variety of unit types that can be further specified for unique combat capabilities or made into a well rounded unit for all occasions. The DLC add lots of new missions and options that affect your relationships, resources, and science. The difficulties in this game does require you to change tactics and become more punishing. So far this game also has a lot of replay value. I'm on my third play through and each one has different challenges based on my decisions to help or raid. You can easily put a few hundred hours into this game.\n\nCONS\nIt's not without issues. For me there are three \n1. Heavies need to be rebalanced, they don't have anywhere near the usefulness of the other classes until late game grenadiers. \n2. The camera is a bit frustrating on the combat map (inverse controls when you use the mouse, until you click on a unit. Then it controls as expected. This can make selecting units and setting overwatch frustrating. The free camera option doesn't fix this.\n3. Menus block you setting overwatch. This issue is amplified by the camera controls. \n4. Enemies to have mist seem to take a long time (sometimes up to 2 minutes) to decide how to move/act on their turn.

So I loaded up PP with no great expectation that it would be radically different and oops, did I just get my backside handed back to me, on the lowly vetran level?  Oh yes, this game is hands down a better tactical experience. It will keep getting better too.\n\nYes PP still has issues, like the strategy layer where it's easy to get stuck in mid game wondering what to do next, unlike in XCOM 2 (Firaxis version) which more or less holds your hand and walks you through (Yes, I know Bradford, you tell me this every single time I get here).  And yes they still have bugs and are still building a library of DLC to meet many a players expectations.  Where as I'd prefer them to firstly improve the soldier customisation options, bring in more voice actors and link the information up on screen, rather than clicking through various menus to find that bit of info that makes the difference.  Yet for all the little niggles and missing bits this game is a gem that is quietly getting polished. The back story is rich , really rich with some nice comical touches, and oh my Lord, when the modders get their hands on this...\n\nOn a slightly different note, this game loads faster and runs cooler on my ageing laptop then XCOM 2 does.  This wasn't something I expected and it's a nice little bonus.\n\nSo I recommend PP, even though it's still being developed, but let's not forget that XCOM (Firaxis version) wasn't without it's issues too; like the dreaded 95% chance to hit with a shotgun to the face, meaning it's a guaranteed miss, or the sniper shot fired at 90 degrees to the target (What the what!), or the poison spit that hits your grouped units after passing through a wall and the flooring from below (Oh you are taking the ...).  I've not had any BS from the tactical layer in PP after 322 hours of play.  My shots go where they are aimed, even if it's a miss, so my expectations are not dashed on the rocks of RNG.\n\nNow if I can only remember that line of sight doesn't mean line of shot and that my sniper can shoot that Arthron through a 1cm gap between cover half the map away.

I just fought 3 artillery units that fire 3 suicide bombers each for like 3 hours and your telling me if i made a ground transport i could have wiped them out with ONE SHOT?!?!???!!!!!?!?!?!????.as if thats not bad enough it leaves  part of the story out. i spent three hours shooting a fucking lair up and a cheap transport could have done it quick? so much time wasted. the I like a lot about the game but some bs just wrecks it. the worst one out of bs is the panic mechanic. there supposed to get paniced and run for cover if i remember right,but that never happens, instead as your about to wipe all the threats near by out everything more than under control they just killed a mini boss which you would think boosts moral they panic and run directly out into the bullets being fired and stand there for an entire turn, basicly killing them selves. not like one or two but every guy you have the new ones, the master chief ones that some how lived through so many missions you lost count and almost died each one, the ones about to take a shotgun to the face of the already bleeding out guy, everyone all at the same time. I have been playing on the hardest difficulty the whole time this is how 90% die. they have a ton of high ground spots, places that should give a massive advantage in most fights,and when your barely scrapeing by not reloading because you cant afford ammo you need that sort of advantage so you dont waste ammo hitting shields. if you get to them most of the time you cant shoot,the guy just looks at the railing and cant think ohh i should put the gun on the rail, it would steady my gun aim makeing me more effective at long range and i can shoot over there sheilds and kill them with less then 20 bullets. instead they just go crap theres a rail there lets just point the gun at it and only it. also those videos lie that light blue circle is only about 50% of your shots,and even your snipers miss when there barrels literaly touching there head. I had this one incredibly bs moment when a mini boss mind controlled a guy with a shotgun, you stop it by shooting the head off, yes all of them still live or by killing them. the guy was half dead out in the open 10 ft away from my whole squad. sniper entire dark circle on the head .0000001 chance to miss, misses. 4 other guys the same or close enough where it should not make a difference, all miss. the guy lives. shot gun guy lives fataly wounds one, mini boss mind controls my heavy guy with a literal cannon, tank sized and kills 2. you see where thats going. ohh and if you didnt guess the mini bosses kill so much more then the boss, move faster everything but size and hit points better. the boss sits back and is more of a support traping and paralizeing, like an 8-14 turn kill if your lucky with an entire 8 person squad, the one time i almost got him wiped out a leg and he left. beyond that theres a few things i wish they change. when your guys die it keeps there stats lists them as k.i.a but does not show there kills if you let the guy bleed out to save ammo or shoot another guy.also they become so armored at a point in the game where its a better option to disarm them often quite literaly and they retreat and leave once all ways of attacking are gone this is the way i deal with them when i can because im that desparate for ammo with theses crap inferior guns. It leaves that out too and im looking at it like wait that was the guy that took half the enemy team out in 2 turns in at least 3 missions, why does it say he has 3 kills. also very little explination about how it works spent about a day learning with one guy that somehow lived the whole time last to die. no multiplayer either. one last thing theres no way to place your troops at the start of a fight. defense missions its 1000x worse scatters everyone all over even though they saw the attack comeing for 24 hours and some just out there siting in the open others so far in the base you need to wait 3 turns to be able to waste a shot.not sure what happened but they slipped up on a lot of stuff, this game could have been huge but the bs kills it.", "timestamp_created": 1612600611, "timestamp_updated": 1612716199, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454862773418426514", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "86048108": {"recommendationid": "86048108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868847607", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3466, "last_played": 1612462167}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game overall, but a little obtuse at times", "timestamp_created": 1612587032, "timestamp_updated": 1612587032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496987968683242798", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "86044201": {"recommendationid": "86044201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001889741", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7430, "last_played": 1617331959}, "language": "english", "review": "Its pretty good", "timestamp_created": 1612581259, "timestamp_updated": 1612581259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496987968683242798", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "86019699": {"recommendationid": "86019699", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994322401", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3219, "last_played": 1614365827}, "language": "english", "review": "much like the original xcom", "timestamp_created": 1612547860, "timestamp_updated": 1612547860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496987968683242798", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "85983171": {"recommendationid": "85983171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034978535", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7077, "last_played": 1611871916}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a good game.  90% of this game is masterfully done, 10% was mostly ok.  \n\nComparing the tactical combat to the more recent X-com games, this game fixed everything that bugged me about X-com combat.

Is Phoenix's base just let they front door open all the time so the enemy can get in freely?\nAble to set up your unit or have defensive turrets or wall can be really helpful so you don't have to waste your resource to build second troop just to defend.

Don't provide an interesting tactical experience.\n* Few palettes between maps. 3 for Anu, 3 for NJ, 3 for Synedrion.. all very similar. 1 \"jungle ruins\", 1 cave, 1 annoyingly ugly crusty cluttered alien thing (the lair), 1 prettier alien thing (the citadel), 2 ruined industrial yard (grassy or dirty) --- some special maps use a mixture of these (forgot to mention the 6 or so different LoA maps)\n* Height variation in maps only exist within destructible terrain (buildings), no hills or rivers or ditches\n* Story Mission design is basic and resembles regular missions - leads to far too much repetition\n* Map design is too cluttered and nonsensical - objectives in all maps tend to play the same as all other maps.. nearly every mission feels the same, regardless of the actual differences (especially in regards to tactics to overcoming the mission/enemies)\n* Player is overpowered, difficulty is nonexistent (Legend here is the same as Easy in War of the Chosen basically) - customization of skills/stats/equipment can create living gods among your troops. Enjoy beating missions in 1-3 turns with no challenge or satisfaction resulting from feeling like you pieced together a puzzle... because you're \"solving\" the same \"puzzle\" over and over again.\n* Faction Diplomacy is basic to the point of actually being detrimental to the experience\n* RPG elements clash with strategy/tactics elements of the game causing both aspects to suffer. Overpowered superhuman gods, and the fact that losing a soldier is incredibly detrimental making balancing difficult unless it favors the player (partially to blame for the no difficulty in the game I believe)\n* Clashing aesthetics. Gear can be mixed but never matched. Customizing colors never works properly.\n* Random flow of game - do whatever you feel like, almost nothing matters. enemies can be easily beaten with lvl1 naked soldiers one month into the game still (this alone isn't a complaint, actually a good thing imo... just not done well)\n* AI has been dumbed down and is repeatedly exposing themselves to danger\n* Resource gain is unpredictable unless you Raid/Trade - raiding can be exploited - resources can be negligible - everything else becomes pointless as a result - trading is a tedious act of click to move to a point, drag a slider, select, click to move to a point, drag slider, select, repeat indefinitely. more aircraft trading, more you're doing this.", "timestamp_created": 1612316769, "timestamp_updated": 1616210252, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493421047925949097", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "85845835": {"recommendationid": "85845835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321721785", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 5238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3976, "last_played": 1613282947}, "language": "english", "review": "Es como cuando te pasan The Dark Knight y a\u00fan cuando ya la viste unas quince veces, te pones a verla una vez m\u00e1s.

E.g if an enemy has no means to hurt you anymore, he's basically taken off the board. So if someone has just a 2-handed weapon and you shoot off one of his arms (or destroy the weapon), he's no threat anymore.\nIt also gives more immersive feedback on your hitchance than a simple number; and since a lot of the weapons fire in bursts and each projectile is rolled seperately, it doesn't need to artificially roll a 'glance' or similar for you, you just hit with 3 out of 6 bullets on a bad shot and that's it.\n\nThe 7 classes can be combined into 21 different 'cross-classes' (since Sniper/Heavy is the same as Heavy/Sniper) and while some combinations are more obvious than others, each ability has at the very least their niche where it comes handy.

Did you like those? Were you hoping for a fresh take from the godfather of the genre? Well then get Chimera Squad or Long War. \nI really want to like Phoenix Point. The aesthetics are great, it's a world three Crab apocalypses deep, and the survivors are scarred. Accordingly, the diplomacy is a step up from XCOM's country management. Do you make nice with fascist Elon Musk? How about the Church of Crabology? Maybe you're into high tech anarchy? The choices feel, initially, unique and compelling as your ships traverse the globe and you struggle to fight the literal tide of ocean borne monsters. When you do get to fighting the way turns break down is easier to manage and makes each bad move less punishing. I don't feel like a misclicked tile is a death sentence in Phoenix Point, for instance.\nBut.\nIf there's a word that's missing in this game, it's polish. For instance, you can free aim a shot, creating a kind of VATs system where limbs can be freely targeted. A head isn't always the best target either. Tritons have four arms, there's no disarming that. They are always better served with a chest shot. But sometimes at close range your shots clip through the target. Or at long range, a bit of cover blocks the shot in a way you can't anticipate. If a character is taking a regular shot, they'll step out from cover, but if you free aim it, they don't. That should've been a fairly straightforward fix, but it's not here. The same applies to overwatch. If you don't demand an overwatch over completely open ground, expect to miss. Cover too, doesn't actually cover much, so expect return fire to hurt almost always. A full shield just means your character will lean forwards and stick their head out, and you can expect the AI to nail a few shots. \nThen there are the mechanics that just don't work, or aren't explained at all. Did you want to capture something? You'll be told to build a tazer, but not that you have to taze the enemy above its threshold, then just ignore it for the rest of the mission. Depending on the enemy, that's an extremely tall order too. Not that anything in the game will tell you that. The enemies themselves also feel imbalanced, even with late game maxed out powers. One melee heavy enemy will spawn a doppleganger on its corpse, which is almost impossible to gun down with overwatch, and can easily one shot a character if you haven't killed it further back. Even then? Expect a hit or two. \nThen there's just the mix of busted, over aggressive AI on some, and potato brains on others. It's not that I can't deal with an enemy that corner camps and spams artillery while the rest of the foe charges, it's just no fun at all to deal with. It makes every missiontake another five real world minutes What about a siren that can control up to two soldiers a turn? In a squad that, if you brought a vehicle, might only have three? Essentially some builds and class types become useless, but even then playing well leaves you feeling cold.\nBasically the end tier to this game is tedious and frustrating. You'll not feel overwhelmed, just constantly annoyed. Since the first draft of writing this, I've played almost exclusively base defenses and panic missions, 2-4 a day, while I wait for the final research missions to wrap. There's nothing more to it, it's just tedious and annoying. Each wave of missions plays out with a level of jank you didn't ask for, and after a year and three dlcs, feels unacceptable to see.

It offers decent amount of playtime (it took me about 150h to complete everything). However, I feel that the game is quite unpolished, which is really disappointing given that they agreed to Epic Games' exclusive to get money upfront \"to polish the game\". There is a lot of balancing problems, serious bugs and other minor issues. I think [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/559100]Phantom Doctrine[/url] was better.\n\n[h1]Good things[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] More classic action point system that gives you more freedom of moving and shooting. Every unit has 4 action points, attacking requires 1-3 AP depending on the weapon size and that can even be decreased to 0 with certain abilities. Each unit has speed parameter (usually 15-30) which defines how many tiles the unit can move in a single turn. However, moving one tile consumes only a fraction of the action point.\n[*] Free aim. You don't just order to shoot at enemy, you can actually aim with your soldier which allows you to see the bullets spread of the weapon and target specific body parts.\n[*] Targeting and destroying body parts. You can cut off alien's arm or destroy their weapon,you can damage their legs so that they bleed and walk slower, and so on.\n[*] Realistic bullet trajectory - no more bullets hitting an enemy and seeing \u201cmissed\u201d pop up. Bullets damage what they really hit.\n[*] Multiple bases and aircrafts. You have to actually make tough decisions on the strategic screen, manage multiple teams, consider the speed of aicrafts to be able to respond to attacks and so on.\n[*] A very interesting choice of skills and classes. Together with dual class it opens a way to some very powerful combos.\n[*] Soldiers in overwatch shoot one-by-one rather than all-at-once.\n[*] Soldier's movement is stopped when they spot an enemy (although you will lose some AP).\n[*] The story is interesting - rather than classic alien invasion and UFOs, the humanity has to deal with a deadly virus that mutates living organisms.\n[*] Equipment pool is global - this might not be a good thing, however if I had to transfer equipment and ammo between bases, it would add a lot of overhaul. Also, ammo crafting is instant and you can automatically replenish soldiers ammo at the end of the mission (at the regular crafting cost).\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Bad things[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] Tradeoffs. There is no clearly better weapons/armors/vehicles (excluding DLCs), all items are just different and you have to decide what parameters are most important for you.\n[list]\n[*] For example, basic helmet sensor mod gives motion detection, but if you complete advanced sensors research, you will be able to craft a mod that gives thermovision instead of motion detection.\n[*] I have spent first 30-40 hours using the basic assault rifle, because nothing else I discovered was better. Take for example the end game assault rifle [spoiler]Piranha AR-51 - although it has 15 armor piercing and 40 damage, it fires only 4 projectiles. Starting Ares AR-1 deals 30 damage and 1 armor shredding per each of 6 bullets. So if enemy has no armor, AR-1 will deal 180 damage, but AR-51 only 160. If enemy has more than 55 armor, AR-51 will do nothing to the enemy, but AR-1 will shred the armor eventually. Also, AR-51 has lower effective range.[/spoiler]\n[*] Same goes for aircrafts - if something is faster, it has lower capacity (but luckily you can send two aircrafts for the mission and pick the soldiers from both). So all the hard worked research doesn't give you anything better, it gives you something different.\n[/list]\n[*] There is a lot of tactical missions. Really a lot. And no auto-resolve. If you send an aircraft to respond to an attack, by the time it arrives, you are likely to complete 3-4 other tactical missions elsewhere. So if it turns out to be too slow, you won't be able to load an earlier save. There is no time in strategic view when you are just waiting for a mission to pop up. There is always dozens of things to do.\n[*] Unclear and clunky stealth mechanics. Even if soldier has 100% stealth, enemies will still shoot at them. It still makes the game easier as you don't have enemies from the entire map rushing towards you, but forget about running between enemies undected.\n[*] Inability to reorder, rename or scrap aircrafts.\n[*] You cannot skip movement animations or issue move order while the previous soldier is still moving.\n[*] No quick save/load and although saving is quick, loading takes ages (30+ seconds).\n[*] Game in borderless window minimizes on focus lost.\n[*] There are some long scrollable lists of equipments with very limited (or none) filtering options and no search.\n[*] List of soldiers auto-scrolls whenever you move soldier between base and aircraft.\n[*] Not much customisation, neither functional (like weapon mods in [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/237950]UFO: Afterlight[/url]), nor cosmetic. Your soldiers will rarely wear the whole set of armor, making the soldiers look rather ugly.\n[*] Low replayability - no randomness in regards to map objects - all Phoenix bases and havens are always in the same places.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Lots of bugs (these are still bad things)[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] Loading a game in tactical mission is pretty bugged and doesn't save the state correctly. You won't be able to use certain abilities, claiming that they were already used this turn (even though it was actually the previous turn), enemies will do nothing on the following turn (nice exploit if mission is too difficult...). There is also another heavy exploit using neutral soldiers [spoiler]as once they are under Phoenix control, save-loading the game resets their AP back to 4...[/spoiler]\n[*] [spoiler]Sniper's Marked for Death[/spoiler] skill doesn't do what its description says and can be exploited easily. [spoiler]I read that it was nerfed from giving +50% multiplicative stackable bonus to +10 damage per bullet, however other than description, nothing has changed. Use it a few times on and[/spoiler] you can kill everything (including the final boss) with one hit.\n[*] Passing items between multiple soldiers standing next to each other is pretty bugged. Items don't get moved despite consuming action points, another time items get cloned (yet another exploit).\n[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/839770/discussions/0/3102386014773768635]5 unobtainable Steam achievements.[/url]\n[*] Repeller Module helmet mod doesn't restore will points in contrary to what its description says.

On paper, there's a lot to like here if you're a fan of X-COM.  The strategic map is well, more strategic in Phoenix Point as you have to carefully decide how you are going to allocate resources to best fight the mutant menace.  You also have to pick and choose which faction(s) you'll back, which you'll raid and when since after all the best way to get resources is to help a faction against their attackers, but if you piss off one faction too soon you'll lose any hope of getting resources.  Your soldiers are also fairly unique, each soldier gets a random assortment of abilities they can unlock  from their class and you can choose what stats you want to improve as they gain experience.  Units can also eventually learn a secondary class granting them access to even more abilities.  You can give soldiers a different helm, chest piece and leg armor, any weapon you have the ability to make (though they do best if they have proficiency) and more.  In the tactical combat the idea of being able to see what your digital soldiers are shooting at is a great idea, although I will note it does not fix the issue of frustration when a bullet just happens to go into the one tiny spot where it could miss.\n\nHere's where Phoenix Point falls apart though, most of the action that you can take in combat are not interesting.  The abilities you can unlock for each character class are either passive buffs of minor importance or abilities  you can use to do something like moving or shooting at a reduced action point cost.  What's more, the vast majority of enemies you face won't have anything more interesting to do either.  Most of the mutants in the game come from two \"base\" mutants that over the course of the game gain new mutations making dozens of different variants, but pretty much all of these variants end up with \"I have a gun\"; the end result is that pretty much every fight is very samey.  I'm fighting fascists in power armor?  Get in cover and shoot them.  I'm fighting humanoid robots?  Get in cover and shoot them.  I'm fighting mutants?  You guessed it, get in cover and shoot them.  In X-COM there are different reasons to shoot different enemies at different times, forcing you to prioritize certain enemies and attack them in different ways...but by and large that doesn't apply to Phoenix Point.  With the exception of a handful of late game enemies, every enemy pretty much fights the same and you in turn pretty much fight them in the exact same way too; an endless cascade of bullet casings that don't really add up to much.

But most mechanics are either super boring or super unintuitive. The AIs, unbalanced weapon, boring research, unintuitive mechanics.\n\nFaction, super boring, the special mission faction mission feels like normal mission, the map are boring. Like you have a special mission where you assault one of the evil faction MAIN BASE and delete them off the map, and the map is super bland. You feel like just another normal mission. Remember when you assault Exalt HQ, you fight in a big building with lots of guy inside, the theme of the building fits the mission. Yeah this game just use the same reused assets.\n\nThe realistic targeting. \"Hey you can see the enemy from here.\" Oh it turns out you can just see their legs or there is annoying barrel in the way. So sometimes the game became you inching your soldier to make sure there is nothing annoying in the way.\n\nThe body parts mechanic. It is interesting and it's how you win gun fight, like if you target the arms that is holding the shield, it would make them drop their shield. But they make some weapon really strong and the whole mechanics unintuitive. You know how most guns needs two arms to use? Yeah so if you destroyed one of their arms, now they can't use most weapon........and this makes sniper really scary. You and the enemy can target the arms and that unit is pretty much out of the game.\n\nSometimes the AI are good, but sometimes they're horrible. And they're really predictable, this unit is always going to do this and that. Friendly AIs most of the time are useless, they don't use cover. Also don't know why but sometimes the enemy doesn't move? like you end your turn and they would do nothing.\n\nWeapons, most weapon I would say are balanced but some weapon are utterly broken. What do you want? Inaccurate rocket laucher that only have 2 shots and deal small amount of damage, or super accurate laser that can kill most small enemy or disable important body parts.\n\nResearch, the cooler stuff are hidden behind faction, capturing live enemy which you expect give you cool stuff, nah, here is 10% extra damage...........\n\nThe enemies are absolutely broken. Super tanky mind control unit that have insane movement, pretty hard to hit, loves to hide, and have deadly melee weapon. Sniper that can go invis when shot. OH you just killed an enemy? let's make them spawn a new enemy when they die and make them twice as tanky as the original host, give them insane movement range and deadly melee weapon.\n\nAnd there is lot of mechanics that they don't really explain to you. Like the accuracy/chance to hit is not tied to the soldiers and their experience but their weapons. What Stealth, Perception, Hearing stats means. What's the different between Day time mission and Night time mission. How you have different damage types, Bleed, Poison, Acid, Virus, Daze, Shock, etc. Some of them do similar thing but they have different calculation. How Heavy weapon are hold on waist level so they have a hard time aiming something below them. Or how the shape of the cover can affect how much protection you get or block/provide line of sight.\nI basically have a lot \"Oh you can do that since the beginning!?\" or \"Wait why I can't do X from here?\"\n\nOh also there is no feel of progression on the research side and the soldier side. Normally you have early game tier, mid game tier, and late game tier weapon and armor. Nope, you don't have any mid game stuff, and the late game stuff are locked behind faction, so most of the game you're going to use the same old weapon. So the late game doesn't feel a lot different than mid game.\n\nTLDR; This game is pretty unique but really unpolished and unintuitive.

I have no idea why so many people gave this game a bad review, or perhaps that Steam is showing all the negative ones. \n\nThe new AP system and ballistics in this game are like a breath of fresh air and future XCOM games need to have this same system. I hated that feeling in Xcom when you missed and 90% shot. In this game you will miss as well but at least if you are shooting a burst a portion of your shots can still hit, this system is much better. The voice acting is pretty good, i love the art stills that you see in the game, and the story is okay. \n\nThe game is built in the Unity engine i think, and although its pretty good there are some janky graphics that come up from time to time. Some debris will go flying to the moon when hit by a vehicle that is traveling at a moderate speed. Or when the nearby environment is destroyed in combat, it looks ridiculous and silly sometimes, but to be honest there were issues like that in Xcom as well i think. Some other people mentioned that the overwatch feature in this game is broken af and that your troops will shoot at the wall that enemies are passing through. i have experienced that once or twice but i think the system does work pretty well for the most part and i think that complaint was also blown out proportion.\n\nOtherwise than that i like this game. There is a decent variety of weapons, soldier classes, etc. Missions are pretty basic (kill all enemies, save civilians) but i don't mind. My main complaint is that for some reason the base management feels kind of weak here. in Xcom when you add a new section in the base you get a significant bonus to something or you unlock new tech... here you can unlock new tech as well but the bonus feels small: my science research went from 1 to 2 and i just spent a bunch of resources building that lab.", "timestamp_created": 1611551649, "timestamp_updated": 1611551649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "85300403": {"recommendationid": "85300403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859243762", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1692, "last_played": 1611682340}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly recommend this game, if you enjoy xcom then you'll love this game, the style of the game makes it feel like i'm playing xcom but they've added stuff that makes it more realistic and immersive, the storyline so far is good and i am enjoying playing through it, i also enjoy how there are diplomatic options and different factions will react to you differently depending on how you play.", "timestamp_created": 1611538870, "timestamp_updated": 1611538870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "85290593": {"recommendationid": "85290593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045591461", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1511, "last_played": 1611522565}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is definitely just scuffed x-com.

Every single character has no defining features, no significant advantages and no significant increase in stats. Just why? Your soldiers reach max level so fast and then all their xp is wasted.

The research is super lame as you don't feel the power increase of weaponry. Or atleast in the same sense as XCOM does when you get Laser / Plasma upgrades:)\n\nIt feels very clunky aswell. You are not allowed to move multiple units at the same time and the move animation will take up alot of time. (Yet again; In XCOM EU/XCOM 2 you can order another move order once someone is running. It's a small issue for some. A big one for me.)\n\nTo finish it off i'd like to say this game is kinda crazy on the higher difficulties.\nI've finished XCOM 2 Impossible Ironman fairly recently. It took a ton of tries but i did it.\nHere i'm unable to play on veteran without save-scumming. The opposition gets some crazy tools at their disposal: Pretty tanky mindcontrol units (that love to run and hide once they mindcontrol somone btw) acid artillery. You name it!\nEven the 'fodder enemies' become quite dangerous later on as they get a resurrection ability. So even if you kill it it comes right back to cut you down the next turn.\nThe upgraded armours tend to have a negative accuracy penalty to them aswel and it's just annoying.\n\n\nTL;DR: I *really* wish i enjoyed this. The concept is fantastic but the core gameplay just feels like work.\nEvery time i booted it up both on the steam and epic version one thing ran through my mind: Boy i wish i was playing XCOM 2 right now.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1611453314, "timestamp_updated": 1611453314, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502484798431396484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "85234107": {"recommendationid": "85234107", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970777844", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 20301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11900, "last_played": 1614455749}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like Xcom 2 but with less polish and way more content. Xcom vets should really check this out as it has many features your used to and a decent amount of curve balls such as bases, havens and resource management. Down the road you get to mutate/cyborg enhance your soldiers along with choosing a second class for them like Sniper/Infiltrator or Heavy/Engineer and all the while your main enemy is mutating its own forces to counter your research (but only up to a certain point).\n\nOnly a few minor annoyances but nothing really to complain about. Small things like \"free aim\" sometimes did not work when standing behind obstacles so you had to rely on your soldier picking a body part and shooting from cover.\n\nI'd honestly keep playing this game after beating it as it can look rather bleak once you feel ready to take on the end game mission. It would have been nice to watch the \"bleakness\" recede while you still help havens defend themselves. \n\nAnyway, two thumbs up.\n\nEdit:\n\nAbout towards the end of my second play through and once you know how to manipulate the trade system and can raid your allies for supplies (that also trains up your squad) then your pretty much just waiting for your choice of end mission to pop up. I've got 5 squads, 4 on haven guard duty around the world and my 5th is the cream of the crop that does the hard missions and can wander the earth at will. (Uses the slowest ship but allows max of 8 capacity)\n\nI also tried to get into the melee unit of this game but found it underwhelming even with max skills and stats. Sure, they can chain kill (way better after cyber upgrade) and take more damage but pretty much die just as easily when going toe to toe with a melee spec'd baddie. Priest units sound fun but still can't bring myself to build one up. I need the squad slots for 2 snipers,  2 assault, 1 heavy,  1 engi, and 1 stealth/scout.\n\nSide note: On second play through found a new mission type where you can \"rescue\" a vehicle instead of solders. Spiffy but I never use vehicles since they take up two slots on transports.\n\nSide Note 2: Screw you ambushes. Enjoy killing my one guy I sent to scout with no armor or weapons.

I get it, the game is basically x-com survival mode, with enemy that will eventually win, and you are racing to come up with a solution before that happens.  The problem getting to that point is a long tedious slog and if you f-up it can be a major blow which one cannot recover from.  God help those that would play the game in ironman mode and not do some serious research beforehand, you could wind up playing a defense mission that is simply too hard and wreck your squad that is simply unreplaceable.\n\nThe mission that made me quit was an allied based defense mission (which is a mainstay of the game, it is basically a terror mission from x-com but you will do dozens of times.)  The numbers made it look like it was doable.  Until I do the mission and find out it is mini kaiju boss pandoran and its retinue of snipers and mind controllers.  My squad gets recked by turn three as one my guys are dead two mind controlled and suck allies on the other side of the map who were crushed by turn two.  It is doable with the right squad but since the right squad was on the other side of the planet.  Let us just say it is infuriating to get near total party killed by a killer cpu cheap move.  Did I mention that it takes about two to three guys to generally kill a regular pandoran and the whole squad to kill the boss monster?  Gun magic can help but you need the right gun magic and that can only be gained by xp not gear.\n\nOutside of my scrub complaint other things that I didn\u2019t like.\n\nThe setting takes place after the end, but you have three major factions in the entire world which weird ideologies that make it feel like you\u2019re playing Alpha Centauri game (only worse since you play mercenaries who is doing all the work and getting shit pay in the process) instead of x-com.  Hell, I wish I can play one those factions instead of Phoenix Point since at least they can get their own resources.\n\nAnother complaint I have is the game is really freaking stingy with it\u2019s rewards.  It take about two terror missions to kit out one soldier, while also having demands on base and vehicle constructions and recruitment costs.   Granted you can trade which helps a little bit or steal which is difficult.  \n\nTo sum up it\u2019s like Firaxis X-COM but worse, with flexibility that you wished had in X-COM but the punishment you get for it make just appreciate the causal mode that you got with X-COM \n", "timestamp_created": 1611439162, "timestamp_updated": 1611439162, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497630327939987183", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "85228411": {"recommendationid": "85228411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074606712", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5132, "last_played": 1616266243}, "language": "english", "review": "Crabs.

It starts off strong and has some nice features that arguably improve over the X-COM series, however, it has many glaring faults that take away the fun factor. Aside from multiple glaring bugs, a bare-bones UI/World map and the lack of basic features such as loadouts, the game gets more and more painful the farther in you get. The pacing slows down dramatically in the mid to late game as you constantly find yourself on call to defend allied settlements from attack. The lack of auto-resolve or any kind of automated defense means you have to spend hours chugging along the map fighting samey missions over and over again. \n\nMy biggest issue is with balance. The game raises its difficulty with unfair mechanics and by throwing masses of highly equipped enemies at you. This may not sound like an issue but the sheer amount of resources they have available to them make the combat extremely un-fun. First of all, they introduce status effects (virus + paralysis) that not only completely delibitate a character once procced but are also (and I am not exaggerating) completely uncounterable until very late-game research (at least for virus, paralysis has no counters that I am aware of). If this was all you had to deal with, it wouldn't be such an issue, however, on top of enemies with these status effects you have other factors such as heavily armoured, mobile artillery cannons that will pelt you with explosive worms from a distance, forcing you to deal with them or take constant heavy damage. Enemies that will take control of your characters (multiple ones if not dealt with rapidly), with the only real counter being to destroy their heads (which are heavily armoured) and near-invisible snipers that can cripple or one-shot your characters from the other side of the map, who, if you DO manage to seek out and lay down fire on them, can then actually turn invisible and get a free shot on you next turn. Beyond that, you can very easily just get one-two shot, even through cover and with late-game equipment. With an average squad size of 6-8 characters, you can very easily find half of them completely delibitated or dead in the space of a turn. \n\nIt becomes basically impossible to choose high priority targets because, of all of the bodies the game throws at you, pretty much every single one will disrupt/kill your squad if left unchecked. \nThis forces you to either take heavily losses every mission (which is not sustainable) or save scum through missions in the hope that you get an enemy set-up that is lower on the bullshit scale. \nThere are other glaring balance issues but it feels needless mentioning everything.\n\nAll of this serves to make the game an incredibly frustrating drag to get through, do not recommend at all.", "timestamp_created": 1611175928, "timestamp_updated": 1611176013, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 108, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.836591899394989014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "85044250": {"recommendationid": "85044250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348528566", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 3783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 933, "last_played": 1612545153}, "language": "english", "review": "Alas the game has bugs which make the game not playable.

The only thing I could imagine they could do to improve the game would be to increase the biome and level variation throughout the world map, as for a good portion of maps they will spawn you in at a different entry point which starts to feel fairly repetative and I'm at 14 hours right now. Next up would to have more variations to the armor sets so you could really make soldiers of the same class look distinctly different, adding a bit of character to your respective story. Oh the final tutorial they should include, is a better explanation on how exactly to capture aliens.\n\nAll around if you enjoyed X-Com this is a solid outing by the OG creative mind.

This \"shakes up\" the formula with free aiming, vehicles, different gear, and RPG elements, but I feel that all these aspects fall short. The core gameplay is squad combat, but enough small frustrations prevent this from being enjoyable for me.\n\n-The inventory system and encumberance feel unnecessary like trying to tack on RPG elements for the sake of complexity\n-Having more fine-grained actions and movement points is nice, but the markers on the battlefield are incorrect for how many actions it costs (a range shows that it costs 1 action or less to move, but movement costs ~1.1 actions thus making it impossible to follow up with a 3 action cost heavy weapon shot).\n-All the UI feels unnecessarily large with no options to change it (changing the entire game resolution does not affect his either). It feels like a mobile game's UI ported to PC.\n-Jump jets allow you to jump around the map, but you have to be able to get to that location in 20 moves but this navigation is calculated on foot. Why does my soldier have to be able to walk around a building, up a ladder, and back to where I am to reach the second floor when I simply want to jump up above myself to be on top of a one-story building? This ends up not being a legal jump point because it is \"further than 20 steps on foot\". Why not just calculate \"is this space within X meters?\"\n-Vehicles are exciting but their pathing leaves much to be desired. Trying to nudge a vehicle a couple squares forward causes it to move around the entire map in a huge arc destroying a large amount of cover. Preview line of where vehicles will move to is incorrect.\n-Bullets cannot travel through certain foliage. This is especially problematic because of the free aiming system rather than XCOM's roll the dice mechanic.\n-Lacking in quality of life vs XCOM 2. AI takes a long time to do its turn (start turn, pause 4 seconds, walk out of cover 2 squares, pause 4 seconds, shoot, pause 4 seconds, walk 1 square closer to cover, pause 4 seconds, walk 1 more square closer to cover, pause 4 seconds...). Cannot tab-out after ordering a move with one solider. Have to wait for every animation to finish entirely before proceeding.\n-Lack of up front information makes me feel more frustrated and cheated than XCOM. Enemies are already aware of my presence from map start making me want to be even more caucious than the dreaded XCOM march of overwatch.

As a fan of the classic X-Com Apocalypse I enjoyed Phoenix Point. However players should expect to save and reload a lot for tactical battles in the early game.\n\nLots of effort was put into the tactical component of the game, the trajectory of each bullet is simulated. Being able to aim for different limbs is satisfying. Lots of thought was put in by the developers into balancing equipment. Guns aren't strictly better than others, with different trade-offs between them.\n\nHowever there are still quite bugs related to tactical combat, passive statuses aren't updated correctly in battle and modifications to stats granted by abilities aren't displayed properly in the personnel screen. \n\nThe UI could do with more polish, filtering and selection is unintuitive. As your teams grow and more items are available to manufacture scrolling through endless menus is tedious. There ought to be quick save and quick load buttons.\n\nMelee and psychic abilities are not really well thought out. The beserker class is pretty useless because each melee attack with a melee weapon costs 2 AP and they do not get any bonuses to allow them to move faster or do more damage. I found the most effective melee build was an Assault/Infiltrator. Priests don't get any more willpower than plebians\n\nThe end game can be tedious. the game doesn't scale well strategically: it's annoying to have to defend many places around the world with a team of fresh recruits.\n\nSynedrion are a faction of Mary Sue communists.

But its shows that they dont want you to love it any more beyond that. The game is a SLOG when you get out of the early game. Tech trees suck and everything new that you get is rarely an upgrade, more of it does some stat better but another stat worse. There are very few tech tree items that are straight up upgrades. It feels horrible. The DLC adds some stuff that is pretty strong, but with the pacing of the game its feels so bad trying to do the DLC content while you run around the map like a chicken with its head cut off trying to take babysit havens, nests, bases...\n\nThis game does some stuff that X-COM could take note of, the removal of an % based RNG system is nice, the only RNG is the spread of the bullets. The movement system where soldiers stop if they spot something is nice... but thats about it. What it does not do is it does not have good pacing, the player can barely make it through an in game day late game without having to consider fighting at least 7 times. When at that point in the game certain research projects take 3 days to complete. So if you are trying to save havens and your bases expecially, you have to fight so so so so much just trying to wait out research. \n\nThe biggest flaws I have for this game are as follows\n- The overworld squad management system is poorly done, and at least some kind of auto resolve needs to be created for haven defense\n- The base defense is a disaster. Random generation that sometimes locks your vehicles in hallways that they cannot get out of. And enemies always spawn in a room that end in a choke point. This joke of a mission is a waste of time and flamethrower fuel.\n- The tech tree is pathetic. You never feel stronger with your weapons, the skills your people get make you feel marginally stronger, but the weapons barely get stronger.\n- Overall damage values. This game does not promote a lot of the weaponry that it has in place, this game forces one turn (or close to) wipes of enemies, or you get rammed in by the aliens. Alien damage numbers scale harder than yours do by a long shot\n- The final mission. What a cancer mission.\n\nThe good:\n+ The story and general narrative is nice\n+ Vehicles are generally a good addition\n+ Good variety of classes with some moderately interesting skills, only moderately though\n+ Looks good\n\nOverall: 6/10, only because I really enjoyed the first 10 to 15 hours", "timestamp_created": 1610260058, "timestamp_updated": 1610260058, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.76302260160446167", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "84407176": {"recommendationid": "84407176", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979173524", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 11995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11995, "last_played": 1610078618}, "language": "english", "review": " So, I've been waiting for this for a year now and yes, I'm sort of disappointed - I've been playing Julian's games since he was first writing them and this had a fair bit of anticipation built up over it.\n\n The biggest mistake it seems to me to make is that it's framed as a global game, in the style of UFO:EU or XCOM, but it plays more like a sequel to XCOM: Apocalypse, which is to say that the world, the factions and the missions feel small in scope and scale - you're not liberating a city from the alien hordes, you're recovering a robot car from a ruined garage. It might have fared better if you were defending a cut-off region from The Mist and doubled-down on the storytelling as a result. Then there's the fairly steep story curve, which more or less goes from 'bad things happened' to 'after the fast-food wars, all restaurants are taco be, uhhh, one of three factions with no relation to the cultures or nations that existed before. Some of the base buildings seem wonky (I swear there's something wrong with training rooms) and a lot of the possible charm of staffing and developing your bases has been replaced by ubiquitous AI R&D facilities which don't seem to need staffing or indeed, character.\n\n In the tactical games, the enemy don't have a lot of variety (which is ironic, because the mix-n-match mutations ought to have made this a shoo-in, but in effect they mostly break down to 'more armour' and 'different weapon package' and the vaunted line-of-sight shooting makes overwatch a definite crapshoot at the best of times. It doesn't seem as though any of the various factions, inheritors of the world after multiple invasions from the sea have developed 'wall' technology and while there are many 'go and do this thing' missions, they all take place in a number of extremely samey maps drawn from a small number of tile sets that never succeed in looking much like places of business or work, even allowing for said apocalypsi... apocalypses... apocalises... Catastrophes. Oh! And the final mission mostly sucks. I get what they were going for, but 'fight through to the big giant brain and press the Endo-tron 3000 button you got from research is a bit of a hard sell.\n\n But I'm still recommending it.\n\n Why, is because the basic gameplay is pretty good. Missions are short and punchy, many of the weapons are - if underpowered - gratifying to use. You mostly feel smart when you bring something down (ubiquitous enemy return fire skill not withstanding) through combined arms and there's a fairly robust character development system, with a few arbitrary 'huh?' moments along the way. \n\n It has, by all accounts improved quite a bit since launch and frankly, I wouldn't have sunk this many hours in if I wasn't having fun. It's well-made, reasonably intelligent and there's always something going on.

"english", "review": "TLDR: there are better games out there.\n\nI bought it 50 % off and i regrent that purchase a little bit. The game starts of promising and isn`T bad per se, but there are many things to throw a spanner in the works.\n\nTo get the positive out first. I had one moment, that sticks with me. A had to defend an outpost on extreme difficulty the first time. Never had been to a citadel either. So i spawned in a little villiage full of fog. Than i moved my squad a few fight and saw IT for the first time. My jaw dropped and i regretted the life choices of my boys and girls in the field. Great moment.\n\nA few of the bad things:\n1. The game doesn`T explain many of its mechanics in game. You`ll start with no real idea, what to do and how to win. You can reconstruct outposts, but the game doesn`t explain to you, why you should do that. And you get no feedback that you are overextending, which might gite you in the behind hours in the game, since you need an aircraft to get an tradeloop going and generate resources without waiting for outposts of the factions to get attacked. There a a few damage types you can use, but if the enemy isn`t shooting you with damage type X, the game won`t tell, what it does. You can dual-class, but the screen won`T show you the ability of the dual class. With the DLC you can explore archiological sites, but you will be confused as what to do, if you get one, since the game doesn`t tell you, that you`ll need 2 of them in specific pairs. The list goes on.\n\n2. The combat system is not that fun. The game doesn`t tell you when you are going to be spotted. (Its a skill check perception vs stealth). So you can get spottet across the map in round 1 and get bombed by atillery you can`t see and that doesn`t see you but hits you dead center.  Mind control enemies cross half the map, and have enough points to MC your soldier and get back into cover. So you can set your soldiers up, but you can`t really prepare for anything. In a bad way.\n\nThe game also talks about the realistic bullet physics. \"No hit percentages!\" True, but you might be suprised how often your soldiers will just shoot at the pixel of air that your free aim didn`t cover, while the enemy gets headshots across the map.\n\nNot to mention, you can`t move soldiers at the same time.\n\nThe worst, for me the classes just don`T feel that good. In X-Com, you got that feeling for each class and their abilites. The dual classes in PP are necessary but take away from that. The abilities also are often forgettable.\n\n3. Just 2 % of the player-base have finished the campaign. I can see, why you wouldn`t.\nEndgame ist boring. Just boring. About halfway through a campaign, you`ll just sit there, waiting for research, while you play the same defense mission in the same map over and over or attack the same 3 lairs over and over for the next hours. Its not fun. The only time the difficulty ramps up is the last mission, and at least for den Anu-faction, its quite balls to the walls. The enemy will pin you down and bomb you away shooting perfectly over a huge wall. \n\nI`m tired of writing about it, so just play XCom, JA2 or even Gears of War (at leat the combat is faster and the plot isn`t worse).\n", "timestamp_created": 1610134873, "timestamp_updated": 1610134873, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "84292865": {"recommendationid": "84292865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077532313", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 506, "last_played": 1613593328}, "language": "english", "review": "Extreme difficult but better than xcom 1/2 \ngot a lot of fun ! can t understand this ratings.\nusing linux works fine", "timestamp_created": 1610116266, "timestamp_updated": 1610116266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "84291879": {"recommendationid": "84291879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064900124", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 4614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4609, "last_played": 1610369251}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok, i just first the game and unlock one of the ending. \nThis game actually is a good game coming from a small studio.\nSince it is design by the original x-com creator, so i am definitely going to compare.\n\nThis is my rating:\nStory: 6/10 \n(Not really giving me the push to save human kind, when i see them fighting each other, and not doing anything in game)\nGameplay: 7/10\n(Like the shooting mechanic, less RNG compare to xcom, but there are no dodge system, overall less fun and less frustration)\nVisual: 8/10\n(Look great, but fail to create horror or uncanny feel)\nAudio: 8/10\n(Great?!)\nLevel Design: 5/10\n(i could only say final boss is fun, but not good enough compare to xcom/xcom2)\n\nThis game meant this game look horror or uncanny feel, when you look at the environment and enemy.

Realistic, but just adds more things to look after.\n* The resource squeeze forces you to trade with other factions. Which means managing aircrafts to fly around between them. Something that could easily be replaced by an automated trading system that just generates resources over time.\n* With the DLCs come ancient sites. Once conquered, you have to manage aircrafts flying between them to collect mined resources. Something else that could be automated easily.\n* Combat equipment is far too expensive. A hammer costs about 1/4 of an aircraft. Troops go into combat with half-empty magazines because they cannot afford full ones.\n* Weapon balance is off.

So, if you already like XCOM2 and you're looking for a new fix to keep you hooked until XCOM3 comes along whenever that might be, is this game for you? Let's have a quick look at what's different.\n\nCharacter customisation is not as detailed as XCOM2 but it is more than good enough for me. You're not going to be running cute girls around the battlefield in hot pink shorts and a t-shirt, all the characters are military-style, like they were in XCOM1. But you can name them and set up the colour and pattern schemes for their kit.\n\nYou don't have Bradford shouting at you telling you not to let the Berseker Queen get away when you're letting out a huge sigh of relief that the beast is exiting the field. And, after 13 hours in, I have yet to have my in-game performance assessed by some shadowy, bald geezer with a gravelly voice. Don't miss that at all. I know how well I'm performing. (Badly!)\n\nThe tactical maps are gorgeous and you really feel like you're playing XCOM2. However, IMO, tactical combat appears to be deeper than XCOM2's combat. You have four action points instead of two and your characters also have willpower which you 'spend' to activate their special abilities. I really like this. I'd have prefered to have XCOM: Chimera Squad's impulse turns but this is a slight improvement over XCOM2.\n\nThis is also a difficult game. You might feel like you're walking it your first couple of hours in the game but the difficulty ramps up quite savagely a few hours in and you'll need to form whole new strategies for playing the strategic map. You will find it hard, if not impossible to keep all the factions happy so you'll have to pick one aover the others and go with that so that gives the game more replayability as you'll want to see what all the factions have to offer.\n\nThere is so much more to talk about but if you're one of those folks who gets bent out of shape when someone reimagines an existing title, like 'Iratus: Lord of the Dead' did with 'Darkest Dungeon', or 'Knock on the coffin lid' did with 'Slay the Spire', this will cause you a world of pain.

Sorry but it's not, Gollop, campaigned doing a Xcom 3 game with it's fundraiser and also the game gimmicks a lot of Xcom mechanics.\nYou would expect that on ROOKIE, the standard practice of a game in 2021 would be to give you moderately easy challenge.\nThis game breaks that convention, I'm 75 hours of overall gameplay time and still can't finish the game.\nStill on rookie an enemy can kill one of your veteran soldiers with a single punch (or even two soldiers)... compared to xcom this is very diferent, on Xcom on easy or even on medium difficulty soldiers can take some serious beat and don't die like flies.\nAt the final stage of the game, it's gets even worse with the Chira bombs, and sticky slime goo that can rip apart even a veteran squadron of your soldiers in 1 or 2 turns.\nAnd yeah.. adaptative difficulty? my rat ass. It's pretty much broken because devs have to resort to adjusting HP levels of the enemies to fine grain this unbalance mess (such a waste so many neural networks and processing power in my gpu and cpu for the devs to resort to increasing an enemy HP).  I've been investigating this unbalance problem and it seems it's bugging the game since day 1.\nDifficulty just doesn't scale. Veteran players with hundreds hours of gameplay will say that this game is too easy while new players trying to finish their 1st playthrough will say that this game is too difficult.\n(It's fairly evident that difficulty is broken because on nexusmod, there's mods to water down or fine grain better the difficulty)\nThis is a thumbs down review for breaking standard conventions on difficulty, this is 2021, maybe this was a good game for 1990.\nIf you are looking for a game with a fair challenge with normal playtime, in the 20-40 hours range campaign just look another way this isn't . You'd be better playing Mutant Year Zero, Phantom Doctrine, or Warhammer Mechanicus.\n\nAlso imho if you pit this game against other TBS games, there is nothing exceptional about this game. If you are the type of person that has hundred of games in their library, and limited gaming hours per day, I would move on and play another game. This game doesn't deserve a +100 hour playtime, imho.\n\nTo sum it up, Gollop tried to do an Xcom 3 like game, for you to spend hundreds of hours on it, and it missed the hallmark by quite a lot.\nI think that this game problem is being over ambitious, not every game deserves a +100 hours playtime, imho this game would be a much better game if the campaign would be within the 20-30 hour range.\n\nIn the performance aspect, I've run this game on Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 it just runs greats, 60 fps steady on Ultra, there's some minor graphics glitches sometimes in some maps, but it's bearable.

If you're not already a fan, I wouldn't start with this game, there's better examples of the genre out there. The game is nice but pretty messy.\n\nI don't know. I mean, I like it but at the same time I'm kinda bored. I played the game when it first released on Epic and it was a broken mess, practically unfinished, full of exploits, and the final boss didn't even work properly. I remember getting bored about halfway through the game and then discovering the ridiculously unbalanced abilities you could use to really cheese the game, like having your assaults infinitely dash through the map and clear entire missions in single turns, or your snipers unloading their entire magazines into the strongest enemies in the game, etc. I started having a lot more fun and went on to finish the game, however I'm reaching that same point in the game again where I'm just getting bored but now that these abilities have been patched or nerfed, there's a lot less fun things to mess around with. \n\nThe combat can just get kinda tedious, having to target specific body parts to even be able to damage some enemies, often times you'll hit the target but the wrong body part, effectively missing, since the enemies just stack up absurd amounts of armor as the game goes on. Meanwhile disabling body parts completely defeats enemies that don't have other methods of attack, and the same goes for if your soldiers lose an arm. The strategic layer is pretty underwhelming and there's still no UFOs and interceptions, I think a DLC for that is in the works but I really don't know when it could be coming.

The broad strokes of the game are very similar to XCOM: You have a global strategy map, you face an implacable global threat, you train and equip squads of troops, and you go on daring high-risk missions with intricate tactical combat. Even most of the details of how the tactical combat proceeds feel very XCOM, from the satisfaction of getting a sniper headshot to the despair of seeing your squad leader get one-shot. \n\nBut there are some important differences, some obviously good, some more ambiguous. The realistic ballistics simulation, the addition of land vehicles, and the option to build new bases and aircraft to deploy more squads are all excellent improvements on the formula. But some of the more realistic details require more micromanagement, such as needing to keep track of ammo magazines, replacing used medkits and grenades, and equipping each soldier with their own specific armor. Your mileage may vary on whether this increases your immersion or just feels frustrating. The way that enemies continually mutate and improve over time makes for a compelling challenge, but it can also be annoying to try to keep track of so many different enemy types at once. There are like twelve different types of Arthron alone. You will receive periodic intel reports on the new enemies, which are so long and detailed you will want to TLDR them. \n\nThe biggest differences from XCOM are actually in terms of setting and plot of Phoenix Point. The Pandorans are not a alien race with advanced technology; they're more like a virus that mutates and spreads itself through infesting and dominating humans. The situation is considerably bleaker than XCOM: Human civilization is already on the brink of ruin, and the few remaining factions are either naively idealistic (Synedrion), dangerously purist (New Jericho) or just plain bizarre (Disciples of Anu). \n\nIf you love XCOM, you'll love Phoenix Point.

Completed both versions. Inevitable comparisons with XCOM aside, PP does a few things well, and others not so well. \n\nPOSITIVES:\n\n> Shooting is arguably better than XCOM, as there is no % to hit. So no frustrating misses due to that 99% which whiffs. Positioning and weapon choice are rewarded, along with being able to shoot specific areas (like the head of a mind control enemy, or shielded crab etc)\n\n> Action Points are more flexible, with a move, shoot, and move again. Or shoot twice. There are option here that I miss when going back to XCOM. \n\n> Steal stuff. Be it vehicles or research. Again this is more flexibility, that lets you adjust what you want and when. \n\n> Factions. Stereotypical yes, but it's nice to have them around so it feels like the world is also doing it's part combat the enemy. Trade with them, do missions, and also double cross them if you so choose. They need work though..\n\n> Soldiers. Lots of play here for soldier builds, with RNG skills mixed in with multi-class options. Customization is ok, but XCOM trumps it here in a big way. Still, soldiers look quite nice. \n\nMIXED:\n\n> Story. Eh, it's ok. Multiple ways to win though, but you wont exactly be gripped by the narrative.\n\n> DLC Content. A real mixed bag here. The main one, Ancients, throws in new enemies and powerful gear. But it is super grindy and confusing. The smaller DLC gives you augmentations which are good, and gives you more soldier customization. The last one is a small one, with an armor set, and couple of guns that mostly not worth the missions.\n\nNEGATIVES:\n\n> Mid to End Game is quite frankly a mess. Haven defense needs a full rework as you are just spammed with random defense missions as the mist covers more of the globe. And those missions lack interest and meaningful reward. There is no percentage to see if the haven might successfully defend (most times they don't, NJ faction sometimes does win). No option to help them set up defenses, or lend them some troops to bolster future attacks. They are just awful, and keep coming...and coming. \n\n> Doomsday clock. Sigh, does anyone like these? As the lil bar depletes you are supposed to be filled with urgency. But instead you get spammed with haven defense missions as described above. This needs a rework, as the pacing is just so off.\n\n> Character. This is where the big budget clout of Firaxis beats PP hands down. The game lacks a Bradford, and anyone interesting to breath life into the story and tactical missions. \n\n> Enemy design. You like seafood? We got crabs. Big tanks ones, skinny sneaky ones, and slithering mind control ones. Even giant building crushing ones. But still, nothing really memorable that makes you love to hate them. The goo ones just feel cheap and frustrating, while the mind control ones teach you to never leave home without a headshot specialist. Faction enemies are more interesting though, as are the ancients. But the Pandorans are largely forgettable. \n\n>Sound and Music. There is a fine line between atmospheric and depressing. PP often opts for the latter. While combat music just lacks any excitement and bite. Strategy layer music I end up turning off as it is so gloomy. Sound effects are hit and miss, with a few larger ones sounding low budget. Yet the crack of a rail gun is satisfying. \n\nOVERALL\n\nDespite the cracks, there is a good game here and the core is solid. A few mods could easily sort out the issues and add polish. Plus the year one edition is vastly improved over what was released. DLC is ok, but the next one is supposed to be biggest yet. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1609518025, "timestamp_updated": 1609518025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515477776527404785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83729957": {"recommendationid": "83729957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057741521", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1609682047}, "language": "english", "review": "I only put yes because the game play is basically an XCOM rework but the political lean in this game is just nearly insufferable. 3 factions, 1 is a hyper militaristic, xenophobic(?), \"pushing the boundaries of morality in science\", group founded by a billionaire. 1 is a theocratic faction that basically worships mutant jesus but has a \"dark secret agenda\". And there's the socialist, egalitarian utopia. \"They did it, the radicals had won\" is a paraphrase from the story lore. Every thing is so perfect and hyper advanced in this faction and their biggest issue is: \"should we try to live in peace with the murderous mutants who slaughter us on sight or actually try to save humanity?\".

Kind of difficult to work the hit mechanics, no real display of if you can hit your target or not. a bit more intense since there's no \"downed\" feature like XCOM(the main storyline narration character died on my first mission). It takes a bit adjusting to it but it's not unplayable although so far some enemy abilities do seem a little too intense, too early. one enemy can go invisible, untargetable, after being hit. Deploy a smokescreen that covers about 10 squares AND fire out of it and in doing so managed to hit my troop in cover 4 times in a row.

This is one of these good news bad news games.\n\nGood news:\n\nThe free aiming system adds a lot. At first I thought it was going to be a gimmick, but once you learn to read how the system displays information and learn the value in targeting different body parts you wind up making a lot of meaningful choices and getting a lot of gameplay out of it.\n\nThe class combination idea is excellent. The game doesn't have that many classes, but every character gets two. In addition they get three unique masteries which can include the ability to grab proficiencies form other classes. Want someone who uses the heavies jetpack to fly on top of a building where they can deploy an engineers turret while taking shots with a sniper rifle? You got it. There's a lot of uniqueness to the performance of different soldiers.\n\nThe geoscape level gives you good reason to run several squads. They need recovery time between missions, even if just to rest when they're not injured. The aircraft are only so fast and missions can pop up worldwide, there's no guarantee of them being in range of any one squad. Juggling a bunch of different squads keeps the gameplay fresher than having one A-team that does everything.\n\nThe mission variety feels decent. While every mission boils down to one of essentially three things (Go there, grab that, kill that) there's enough difference between mission types that they feel like they reward different approaches. Some feature infinite reinforcements and are best served by a fast squad that does the job and gets out. Others require you to clear the map and benefit more from something slow and careful. They also offer decent trade offs between grabbing extra loot and winning that can make you question if it's reaaaally worth going for that last box or if you should retreat with what you have.\n\nA lot of thought has gone into giving the aliens unique powers that go beyond \"Have more hitpoints, do more damage\". There's already a lot of this in existing titles with psionic and melee enemies doing special stuff, but this at least doubles the sorts of weird attack you could be subjected to compared to other games in its genre. I'd rather not spoil them but it's nice to see.\n\nThe willpower mechanic works pretty well. All special abilities use willpower. Seeing allies die uses willpower. Some attacks drain willpower. Having a body part take severe damage drains willpower (especially the head). If you hit 0 then you miss a turn fleeing and taking cover. Also all psionics are based on \"Is my willpower higher than my targets\" rather than a percentage chance which makes critical moments like mind control feel less RNG. Conversely you can skip a turn to regain willpower and some abilities offer other ways to restore it.\n\nBad news:\n\nThere is a lot of not fun micromanagement to get to the good bits. At the end of a mission you get a button to buy back all of the ammo you fired during the level, but if you don't have the resources there and then you'll have to do it manually weapon by weapon once you do. Doing things requires the right balance of tech, materials, and food - trading one for the other means flying to an outpost and trading things they don't have for things they do - but each outpost has limited supplies and replenishes every so often so you'll need to do a circuit of them every now and again to do basic building and supply.\n\nThe documentation in the game is so-so. Some abilities, equipment and modifications won't work exactly as advertised. Some critical features of them aren't mentioned and you discover them by trial and (mostly) error.\n\nThe game doesn't autosave each turn, which is for the best since it'd be tempting to save scum every death given how tedious hiring and equipping a new recuit is (trade resources for the right types, queue up their leg armour, body armour, head armour, weapon, and equipment to be built seperately) and it seems like the odd misfortune is part of the game rather than intended to be avoided. The thing is: Sometimes the game crashes, or gets stuck on an infinite enemy turn. It's not a lot, you'll only see it once every ten hours of play or so, but if it happens near the end of a long level it's frustrating.\n\nThe interface lets itself down in places and there are a few times that the game seems to trip over its own feet. The first of these you'll probably encounter is that its realistic bullet physics are based on where the character holds the gun, so the heavy weapons users who start with jetpacks are also the ones who can't take advantage of high ground because holding their gun at waste height makes them most likely to shoot their own cover if they're angling downwards. Also just little things like the game automatically switching off a character every time they run out of action points, even if they can overwatch for 0 cost or the last thing you did was activate an ability that reduced the cost of their next shot to 0.\n\nOverall:\n\nThere's more pros than cons and it's taken some risks doing a lot of worthwhile and interesting things. It's a shame that they've failed to nail some of the core stuff, but the bells and whistles?

Late game can turn into a struggle if things did not goes well in the middle.

Enemy strength seems to grow proportionally, or maybe even a bit in the favor of the Pandorans, with regard to weapons research and development.  Stronger forms of Pandorans pop up far faster than new weapon types can be researched and acquired.  Even the pentultimate weapons of the Ancients are a letdown and still do not have the killing power they should.\nPhoenix Point is also too forceful in its storyline.  There are many things the player may wish to do, such as visit havens, conduct raids, and acquire new soldiers from different havens but there is scarcely time to do so with all the Pandoran and other faction attacks.  The idea of putting a time limit on the game in the form of the humanity survival probability clock is a horrible idea.  XCOM did it too but at least in that game there was a way of setting the clock back.  It just makes everything so busy you can't really take the time to play the game 'freestyle'.

The story line is based on the fall of XCOM, the reactivation of XCOM Bases and man kinds struggle to survive.

Training adds points to a pool that allows activation of a skill as well as character development.  I also liked being able to select a starting Country, game randomly selects it now.  I believe that many modern games rely to much on random generation, lazy I guess.  Random generation takes away from the story line and is a disappointing distraction.  Example, you would think you would find books in a library but a random generator will put ammo there instead, sloppy.  Sorry about that, Phoenix Point incorporates elements of the XCOM series but they are bundled so options are limited but it is still a great game but not as good as what XCOM fans are accustomed to, needs more story line and focus.", "timestamp_created": 1609258775, "timestamp_updated": 1609258775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83482688": {"recommendationid": "83482688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073216093", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1065, "playtime_at_review": 2699, "last_played": 1619205310}, "language": "english", "review": "just started playing the game very fun", "timestamp_created": 1609253039, "timestamp_updated": 1609253039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83482306": {"recommendationid": "83482306", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993268419", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 3191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 732, "last_played": 1613877768}, "language": "english", "review": "Really tryed like this game the start is ok but more  and more time goes by game just starts to suck to play.

There is room for improvement and honestly it's not as bad as some of the early reviews made it seem. I will say though that I feel it lacks in items. I was under the impression that each faction had not only their own items such as armor and weapons but that those weapons and armor had upgrade tiers as well such as tier 1 anu assault rifle then tier 2 and tier 3 ect. It was disappointing to see it didn't. It definitely feels like the enemies get much stronger than you much faster while you basically stagnate like 10 hours in, I get this feeling like if you just progress through another mission you might unlock a new set of items to upgrade. I feel like that would of made the game more replayable if each factor had a multi tier upgrade weapons and armor tree. Also the game can be brutally difficult at times. Enemies continuasly get stronger while you basically just have to rely on your own strategy. This game is definitely good but it does feel like it could use just as many tools for yourself as it gives the enemies. Some of the skills also don't seem that useful. You can pretty much skip whole fights without ever using a certain skill. I would recommend trying to redo the skill system so that it feels like it has more meaning and more depth for each unit. There was another review that criticized the Heavy class being almost useless except for having a jet pack. This I feel is actually very much the case if you don't have a New Jericho flame thrower. I feel like the Jet pack should be an add on item to armor and not a whole armor piece in itself maybe it could be reworked or changed. There are other bugs that still persist that I have run into where in one example when your base gets attacked if you have a vehicle, the vehicle will sometimes spawn in a room that only has a ladder for exit meaning that basically it cannot be used in battle even though its on the map because of a bad spawning point. There are little things here and there that sometimes don't make sense but the game is by no means bad.

And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you all about how people were mutated by the air!\n\nPhoenix Point is the brainchild of Julian Gollop, creator of the original X-COM series. As such, it has many of the things that players of XCOM (And Xenonauts) will be familiar with - turn-based battles on tile maps, base building, recruiting soldiers for your squads, and the Geoscape, to name a few things.\n\nWhere it differs is in its story, shooting in combat, havens and difficulty curve.\n\nUnlike the XCOM storylines, where earth is being invaded by extra-terrestrials, PP's enemies are the result of a mist-borne virus that causes people to lose their marbles, walk into the sea, and mutate into CRAB PEOPLE. CRAB PEOPLE. CRAB PEOPLE.\n\nObviously, XCOM Terror from the Deep and HP Lovecraft inspired quite a bit of PP (To the point that Lovecraft is mentioned by name in-game). That said, I really wish the horror was better executed. Aside from narration over still images, there are no real cutscenes. This is a huge missed opportunity, especially considering the revamp of the tutorial introducing some named characters. Remember in Starcraft 2 the optional cutscene of Dr. Hanson becoming infested with Zerg DNA? Considering this is an entire game based around mutation and body-horror, you'd think they'd have fit some truly terrifying (Or at least suitably creepy) cutscenes in.\n\nThe mission maps also lack any variety. There are all of 2 or 3 maps per setting, so you'll become familiar with them very quickly, and this makes the game feel somewhat bland and repetitive compared to XCOM 2 or Xenonauts.\n\nIt's not a *bad* game though. The difficulty curve can be extremely unforgiving, and you should expect to fail or wipe on a few missions, maybe even lose a campaign or two until you get the swing. \"Easy\" is more like playing WOTC on \"Normal\" (or even \"Hard\" at times), but this makes those victories all the sweeter.\n\nSpeaking of combat, I love the Free Aim feature and true bullet physics. It's much more satisfying to be able to see an estimate of where your shots will hit rather than missing an entire burst of shots on a stated 99% hit chance.\n\nHavens are nice, they work similarly to the factions in WOTC, with a bit more depth. They're a mix between that and an AI-Controlled PP equivalent. They're passive for most of the game, but near the end they may declare war on one another to mix things up.\n\nUltimately the game is decent, and if you like TBT games you'll enjoy it. That said, it feels very half-arsed in a lot of places, or at least like you can see the seeds of a good idea that just fell flat.\n\nWith only 1 DLC left to publish by the point of me writing this, I hope they're planning some free content updates to flavour the game a bit more, but I doubt it. Still, pick it up if you see it on sale. In some ways, it's better than XCOM 2 + WOTC. But in many more ways, it doesn't quite measure up.

I've played through the game twice, on Legend and on Veteran. I'd like to point out some of the more glaring negatives here with the disclaimer that PP is a full fledged X-Com-like you can definitely get enjoyment out of. My point is mostly that it doesn't have the kind of design to make it a timeless classic. Playing PP you'll have to put up with some rough edges and unless you're deep into tactical strategy you might be better off looking at some of the contemporary games e.g. X-COM 2 and Xenonauts.\n\n- The game balance is fairly whack. From what I've seen It has definitely improved since the backer/epic builds but still the scaling curve is way out of whack. The early game is passable providing a moderate challenge that rewards tactical play but in the mid-end game one of 2 things happen. Either you're way behind the curve so you struggle to stay alive or you completely stomp by exploiting certain wombo combos to the point where you beat most missions on the first turn. Ideally the challenge would reflect the difficulty you're playing on across the whole campaign, to me this dichotomy indicates that the action point/ will point system is extremely exploitable to the point that it makes tactical play obsolete. As a sidenote, I feel that some game elements are also way too punishing in a way that provides no options for counterplay (E.g. Virus, Paralysis). Across the board there seems to be this philosophy of \"when it rains it pours\" baked into the game and I can't say I'm a huge fan.\n\n- There are too many missions. If you're played Xenonauts its the same concept here, after a certain point you're doing missions just to do missions because you're just waiting for research or some other progression trigger. Many missions don't feel impactful to your cause especially when you can just blaze through them as mentioned before. Of course you can ignore everything if you're already set but either way it's not a good look when you can't be bothered to play the game so you just try to get it over with asap. In Firaxis's X-COM 2 the game is more or less balanced so that a typical campaign will span 40-60 missions, In hindsight that is about the perfect amount so that you always feel like you're progressing.\n\n-There are too few enemy types especially with the amount of missions the game expects you to do.\n\n-There are a fair number of rough edges and missing quality of life functionality. E.g. No unequip all on your soldiers so you have to go through every piece of equipment manually everytime you re-equip, the free aim step out bugs out fairly regularly so you can't take the shot you want or you lose vision when you should clearly have vision.\n\nOverall despite all these problems it's a thumbs up from me but be aware you can probably only get 1-2 playthorughs out of PP before the cracks start overwhelming the experience.\n\n Btw, my unsolicited advice is that you play on the highest difficulty you can manage, my blind playthrough on legend was by far the most fun I had with the game. Somehow when the game is about overcoming the odds it alleviates a lot of the problems I've listed e.g. the too many missions point (When you can't respond to everything because you're behind you've gotta pick your battles and plan for survival instead).", "timestamp_created": 1609065430, "timestamp_updated": 1609065718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83282475": {"recommendationid": "83282475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091769441", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1122, "last_played": 1609060056}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: Some genres shouldn't make absurd design scale-downs in order to make few extra bucks from a console release.

The combat is a copy-paste of Firaxis' XCOM concept, which is bad on a meme-worthy level. Realistic ballistics system could not save it. \n- No mod support.

However, this game is also just as frustrating and buggy as modded UFO-Defense Xcom. If you\u2019re looking at this because you like the modern Xcom, just don\u2019t\u2026 Unless you\u2019re a masochist and like frustrating slogs.\n\nMore Details\nIt seems like this game is designed to only succeed after several playthrough of learning the hard way with significant functional inconsistencies in how systems and missions act, including some stuff that never seems to be explained.\n\nSome (among many) Examples of inconsistencies/bugs:\n\u2022\tExplosive UI indicators are often outright wrong, leading rockets to missing or hitting obstacles you couldn\u2019t see.\n\u2022\tMission objectives are inconsistent and update mid-mission. One mission you might activate an objective and auto-complete. Another will surprise you with extra objectives you really should have known going in, like \u201cKill all enemies\u201d or \u201cEvac all operatives\u201d. \n\u2022\tSeveral times base missions will spawn a room locked off from the rest of the complex, making it impossible to kill anything inside the room making the mission impossible.\n\u2022\tStatus conditions behave inconsistently: Fire for example seems to sometimes work, sometimes not, and may change which it\u2019s doing while the enemy is standing in fire (and is not a fire proof enemy)\n\u2022\tRandom difficulty spikes that require cheese-tactics and meta-knowledge to deal with since you research only ever gives horizontal upgrades.\n\u2022\tSometimes you see no enemies and just have to sprint around, sometimes backtracking to find where the enemies or objectives are.\n\u2022\tGoo: Want to have your entire squad locked in place with no way out for the entire mission and just sit there? Yay. (Goo eventually decays, but if you don\u2019t kill the enemy, they tend to reapply it liberally).\n\u2022\tDaze Mini-bosses: Goo wasn\u2019t enough? Now you can have your entire team dazed infinitely until you quit the game.\n\nRandom other comments\n\nHorizontal Tech-Trees:\nI admit the game gives you tons of tools to deal with problems, but none of the tools are better than what you had, merely different (IE horizontal progression rather than upgrades). So, you never truly become powerful and just constantly struggle to the point of slogging through to the end. \n\nRandom World Map:\nFor better or worse this game is really random, both tactically and strategically. Each game is different, but there are a lot of fail states you can get into early. Start in South America and RNG no supplies missions? You\u2019re stuck with nothing to do. Fail to unlock the proper sequence of bases in Australia? Entire place is locked off, in or out. \n\nStory, sort of:\nThe plot develops, but nothing like the stories from the Archives on the main site (which are great and I recommend) and mostly is just a mess. Most events seem to be due to coincidence rather than any coherent plot reasons. Then we have the Ancients DLC where the civilization that had no evidence excepts scraps of legends left behind suddenly has mines and factories with active sentries lying around no one noticed for thousands of years and three world wars.\n", "timestamp_created": 1609038444, "timestamp_updated": 1609217667, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83256476": {"recommendationid": "83256476", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991084962", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1609118054}, "language": "english", "review": "Great fun.", "timestamp_created": 1609035975, "timestamp_updated": 1609035975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474452555179595947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83251346": {"recommendationid": "83251346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066807775", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1608937135}, "language": "english", "review": "Its just not good, i wish i never bought it.

Just annoying to play because of the issues it has even after one year at Epic - I will say that it is better now than it was from what I have seen originally but that is a low bar.\n\nTLDR: Some good ideas but bad design. I hope the REAL XCOM takes some ideas from this with actually GOOD execution. Not sure how much of this bad design is the fault of Gollop, I like to think that he had the nice ideas but the execution was just bad. If he is actually satisfied with this result, then I am sorry, but then he has lost his vision.\nThe game needed a few more years and was rushed. Maybe they were lacking funds despite the Epic deal, maybe they really didn't know how to program a fun game.\n\nJust a few points instead of a full review because I already spent too much time with this game:\n- Customization is terrible/non-existant. You can change faces & colors and that is it. And you don't really see the faces most of the time anyway because of the gear - if you use mutations or augmentations you don't even get any customization anyway apart from the color & pattern of your armor. Not at all like they originally presented it in the trailers. You cannot customize your armor apart from what I mentioned.\n- The system that makes every single bullet be calculated that they are so proud of that they can't stop telling you about it in the loading screens? It is just annoying. Yeah more realistic and hardcore yadda yadda, doesn't make it any good.\n- Pandoran battles (especially from mid-game on) make the dev failure quite obvious. When fighting the Forgotten, the Pure and the three factions is more fun than fighting the Pandorans, the actual enemies, you must see there is something wrong there.\n- Blood and Titanium added some nice stuff though I still think the limitation that prevents you from going full augmentations/mutations is just a bad decision. Yes, story, the ones who went in all the way got crazy, but this is hardly a reason. I think it is balancing instead but the game has balancing issues anyway so I do not see an issue there. Awakening of the Ancients seems just a waste of time to me, you keep investing resources for little to no benefit. Yes you get some items at the end I guess but nothing that is worth the massive resources you had to invest into getting so far in the first place.\n- The factions are not bad in design but there is just so much wasted potential (which the game is full of). Why aren't the Pure, Forgotten or hell even some large Mafia/Bandit group factions to cooperate with? Why not have the OPTION to work with them instead of the three factions? It is also quite annoying that you cannot really affect relations between the factions at all, you just watch it unfold. Yes I get the metaphor but that doesn't make it good.\n\nBuy only at a discount and even then, I wouldn't recommend it.

But overall, just been disapointed by the formula that theyre using. \n\nFirst off, alot of UI elements are missing, like chance to hit, savable customization options and default gear which makes the game feel empty. This makes alot of the \"not playing the game but building my story\" stuff that helps sell these games -very- tedious, and is just an outright design flaw. Which by itself isnt that bad, but when you combine this with how short encounters are outside of story missions, you spend a very noticable amount of time just clicking on the geoscape doing \"exploration\" dots (which are just random encounters that take several seconds to unlock) or in your barracks just regearing your dudes while handling logistics. Its not the greatest designed system and lacks engagement like XCOM2s 'choose one of 3' method and infinite logistics in terms of non-upgraded gear and detracts the player from \"getting into the game\". Overall it ends up being a very boring grind to queue up even basic gear for new recruits while you start poking around at the games first handful of side missions, which in themselves barely push even a basic story narrative for the first hour or so of play. \n\nIn terms of the combat mechanics. the traditional xcom series each mission has anywhere form 2-4+ \"pods\" of enemies. This game just doesnt do that, so squad level engagements are limited, alpha striking, breaching, etc is just not there. So your squad doesnt feel like this hardcore shock and clear infantry platoon like the game tries to sell its self as.  Its much more like xenonauts where enemies appear randomly and spawned throughout the map, following a objective script. While its not necessarily the wrong way to do it, the presentation of it all is wrong and lacks engagement. Xenonauts counters this by giving you alot of dudes and alot fighting on every map. Phoenix point lacks both as engagements to be smaller, and less tactical in terms of squad synergy overall. And to top it all off theres a performance issue with this as the game will often time out and invisible enemies can take 5-10 seconds each to perform their turns. Combine this with the fact you can't queue up orders while your soldiers are doing basic actions like moving can make the relative short encounters feel like they take ages to complete while you scour the maps. The game does have a sound-esque system to help you find the aliens in the fog of war, but the performance issues with the relatively slow pace of combat make it a downturn. \n\nThat said, the games not all that bad. The story isn't terrible and isn't far from feasible in terms of writing. Though it isnt very engaging, and theres not really any characters to attach to. The faction system is unique and integrated enough to stand on its own two legs as a game mechanic, and the subfactions of each faction help with replayability as they can lead to a variety of alternate endings. Though you can also just ignore them entirely and rush down the cannon-phoenix route. \nRealistic bullet physics also is a very big part of the game, and when dealing with the various mini bosses of the game, is a unique and enjoyable combat system as you blow off their arms and legs and fire your mini gun through walls to hit enemies you cant see on the other side.  \n\n\nOverall though I give the game a thumbs down due to performance issues I experienced, the micro intensive and unsastifying geo-scape and the snails speed overall pacing of the shooting things part of the game. If youre looking for a spin on the XCOM genre with its own unique blend of combat mechanics, this might be for you.

Mostly lacking in content and polish. Would recommend.\n\nI've played all of the reboot XCOMs extensively. I've also played a bit of the OGs, but I never completed them.\n\nPhoenix Point comes along as a kind of middle-ground between the old and the new. Where the new (reboot XCOM) focuses mainly on tactical combat with a brief strategy layer getting you between battles and old is mostly about having the right number of men with the right gear in the right place at the right time, Phoenix Point straddles a fine middle line. Whether or not it does so successfully is up to the player. In my opinion it does well enough.\n\nThe good:\n[list]\n[*] The combat system lends itself to actually interesting gear choices. One of the problems I've always had with reboot XCOM is that there weren't any real choices for gear at any point in the game. You use the best stuff. All your weapons upgrade at once. Plasma weapons are always the best, etc, etc. In this game, there's 5 different types of shotguns, 5 different heavy weapons, 4 sniper rifles, and while there sometimes is a best option, almost all of the weapons remain situationally useful even as you acquire other weapons. This, along with the enhanced strategy layer, is the most important thing that other games like this should try to take away from Phoenix Point.\n[*] Like OG XCOMs, it's not too punishing to lose soldiers, so save-scumming never really felt justified. \n[*] Although tactical takes a back seat in comparison to reboot, the multiclass system allows for a surprising level of soldier customization. However, the way that faction classes are pretty much strictly better than PP classes meant that I had to wait to upgrade soldiers for a while after they hit max rank.\n[*] Strategy is good. It's not better than the OG, but it's MILES ahead of reboot. There's multiple ways of getting the stuff you need to beat the game, and it's balanced enough. There's interesting decisions to make concerning your forces size, composition, and logistics. The research tree kept giving out interesting new gear and items. \n[*] Campaign was decently paced. The only time where I experienced fatigue was in the extreme lategame when uh... every haven was under siege. I wasn't going to do all of those defenses.\n[/list]\nThe mediocre:\n[list]\n[*] The combat is okay. It's not better than the reboot. It honestly might not even be better than OG, because at least in OG it was pretty damn fast-paced. But it's passable.\n[/list]\nSome criticisms:\n[list]\n[*] There are not enough enemies types, straight up. All enemy types should get mutations, at the very least, and there needs to be more base types. The only time I ever felt scared was the first time I got wacked by a tar shadow.\n[*] Atmosphere is lacking. Just felt a bit bland/unimmersive.  \n[*] Polish. This game really makes it clear as to the level of polish and production that goes into Firaxis XCOM. Things like the pervasiveness of voice acting, 2D graphics for UI, multiple skills just not doing what their description say they do, the way all cover gets destroyed in the exact same way, where everything including rocks and walls get turned into super-blatantly-video-gamey polygons with no weight when the get destroyed--- yeah. It's not the greatest.\n[*] Not enough/Not interesting enough exploration targets. Fixing this is easier said than done, but I liked the haven discovery events a lot. A quick and easy way to start would be to give all revealed havens an event (when you hit 25 rep).\n[*] Part-based disabling means that almost all combat comes down to shooting arms or weapons. Turns out aiming for center mass or the head was a lie. Just feels really wrong that disabling an arm means you can't use 2-handed weapons but disabling your head doesn't mean you can't use your brain. This means that free-aiming is rarely a decision. You either aim at the shredded part or the arm/weapon. \n[*] Free aiming should always be available and you shouldn't have to have an enemy present to utilize step-out firing positions.\n[*] Maps, simply put, suck. Maps are one of the most important parts of a game like this, but there aren't any interesting levels in the game, straight up. This was also a problem in the new XCOM games to a much lesser extent. EU/EW had interesting levels, but not enough of them. XCOM2 had a couple interesting levels, alongside randomized tilesets that could sustain some interest due to their nature (and several dedicated modders, credit to them). But the levels ARE interesting. In Phoenix Point, the levels are repetitive and the levels are bland. Random forest. Random house. Nothing feels lived-in. Often times there's no meaningful elevation, just a flat game board with cover dispersed all about; this is especially bad with Synedrion haven defenses, for example. I noticed it on the first glance and when it became apparent that the campaign was going to be ~120 missions long I knew it was going to be rough. It all comes back to polish. \n[*] Mod support. Games in the genre cannot compete with XCOM fairly without it.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1608881564, "timestamp_updated": 1608881564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679119467735290527", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83090522": {"recommendationid": "83090522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041362771", "num_games_owned": 818, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 625, "last_played": 1609066706}, "language": "english", "review": "its like a mobile game of xcom", "timestamp_created": 1608875063, "timestamp_updated": 1608875063, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.381222307682037354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83086148": {"recommendationid": "83086148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053627776", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 43385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9999, "last_played": 1618045110}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like the X-Com games you will love Phoenix Point!  It's a delightful blend of the original 1990s Xcom and Xcom 2 as well as the rebooted Xcom Enemy Unknown and Xcom 2 with a lot of stuff of its own thrown in to boot.  This is not an Xcom game (though done by one of the original Xcom designers) but takes place in a post-apocalyptic world nearly destroyed by a mysterious mist rising from the sea that spreads the mutation generating Pandora virus.  Those infected mutate into horrible mindless(?) creatures from Lovecraftian nightmares bent on destroying humanity.  There are many secrets to be learned as you navigate the demands of the three surviving factions of humanity to throw back the Pandoran hordes and put a stop to whatever is causing this all out assault against all life on Earth.  The game is quite challenging even on Veteran difficulty (suggested for those who are already experienced at this type of game) and took me over 150 hours to complete so unless you are VERY good at the modern Xcom games I would play it on easy your first time through.

I can see myself logging thousand of hours playing this one in the coming years, it's just that good!", "timestamp_created": 1608868853, "timestamp_updated": 1608868853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512141704559326172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83082446": {"recommendationid": "83082446", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971519880", "num_games_owned": 495, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 6590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6545, "last_played": 1608920219}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended for people who enjoy XCOM-style games, but want something a little different.\n\nOne of the key differences is the way combat works.  Cover is not an abstract -40% to hit; it's a physical entity, and the paths of bullets are modeled individually.  Instead of a flat percentage to hit, you have a target circle that indicates the zone where bullets will land.  You can target specific body parts, or shoot weapons out of enemy hands.\n\nMovement is also a bit different.  You get 4 action points, but movement uses fractional APs (firing weapons and using skills uses whole numbers).  Where in XCOM you would find a spot of high cover and dig in, in Phoenix Point it's better to move-shoot-move.  All enemies are active from the start, so there's no creeping and pod-revealing.\n\nEnemies have a handful of base types that get random attributes. It's like enemies have a few chassis types and then a randomized loadout.  Guns, grenades, shields, poison-spit heads... the types aren't as distinct as XCOM, so it feels like less variety.\n\nThere are a couple of things that it doesn't do well. One is limited mission variety: there are a handful of maps, which get some randomization but don't really feel different, and your goal is either to kill everything or touch a square (and maybe evacuate).  In Haven Defense missions you're supposed to protect civilians or buildings, but mostly those are there so the bad guys have something to shoot at instead of converging on you all at once.\n\nThe other thing it fails to do well is to explain the end game.  I had no idea what I needed to do to win.  I just kept researching stuff and playing whack-a-mole for several hours and eventually the factions started building some special structures.  There's one tech you can research that apparently brings about a swift end; they warn you about this, but don't explain what your alternatives are.  (My 109 hours was spent on *one game*.  Apparently I should have built more research centers?)\n\nSometimes the randomization produces a nearly unwinnable level.  (Explosive artillery on a citadel map with no roofs?  Good luck.)\n\nI encountered very few bugs.  There's a nasty one that cause the game to get stuck on the enemy turn. Be sure to save frequently to a pair of files.\n\nIt's got some rough edges, and it drags a bit toward the end, but on the whole it's a fun game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1608863308, "timestamp_updated": 1608863308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83080369": {"recommendationid": "83080369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010769279", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3624, "last_played": 1608829505}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the top turn-based games around.

While the game is a great example on a tactical strategey  game, it does have a few issues. Before i write down my critics, i want to let you know im playing on Veteran (Medium) Difficulty, as i have experience with RTS's.\n\n1. Balancing - Early game: its exceptionally hard to compete against other factions , which seems to be the best way to get resources in the game, enemies from factions such as Diciples of Anu have an ease to one-shot your average soldier, which early game is very punishing. If you were to play the game without fighting or making enemies with another faction, it would make it too time consuming to gain resources to build your bases. \n\nMid-game state: the game sort of forces you to have a second squad of high ranking fighters as well as having soldiers at all the bases you own, which isn't that hard to manage. However, equipment and ammo management is a nightmare, when you have to keep track of all the ammo for all sorts of different guns that enemies don't usually use (which means they have no chance of dropping that ammo type). Second is skillpoint/skilltree management, you'd be forced to send them on missions so they'll be able to level up their abilities, otherwise, they're targeting dummies whom only have good gear to complement them, which later game, is very hard to play missions with as they're too slow or weak in stats to fight efficiently.\nAnother issue early game is that there aren't any hints or tips that tell you that satellite structures in the base with its scans in fact, only scans the explorative locations around base and NOT Pandoran Lairs, info on how you're supposed to repel the Pandorans from infecting more of the planet is unclear, unless by the use of Mist Repellers, which appear late in the game, and doesn't even give you the ability to build ones yourself. Enemies such as \"Scourge\" (I think its called) enemies whom if you kill a Pandoran wraith, will be auto-revived in their next turn. These enemies are imbalanced, as such are the pandoran enemies with pinchers, because they have the ability to walk around in a 1 action point radius, and attack 3-4 times in a row after walking. Enemies such as Pandoran vehicles (The four legged big monster thing) has a variant which causes stalling for turn after turn. There is a variant with a goo launcher, the imbalancing with this enemy is that it can goo once every turn, which if you have regular soldiers and characters on the map, will indefinitely get stuck in the goo, causing to changes to many turns forward, until the monster itself, loses all will-points.\n\n2. Levels and classes\nClasses in the game come in minimal varieties (Unless you've unlocked Diciples of Anu as allies) You start with three classes in game, which all other factions have as well. The diversity of classes are very minimal as the each faction has 1-2 unique classes except the Phoenix Project (Unless unlocked late game). There's not much else to say, but that classes feel a little bit slow and not very diverse compared to each other.\n\nLeveling is fun , and is crucial for characters in this game to become stronger and unlock skills, the leveling is balanced, but feels a little bit unrewarding, essentially, a player could camp out their level ups and only spend the points in skills late in the skill-tree, which unappreciates the other skills, potentially making them worth less or less useful at least. ranking up characters in general is fun, and id recommend adding more levels to the characters, and maybe add skills to them that would make them stand out a lot better towards other classes. A good example of class diversity is comparing the technician class to the soldiers class, which might/might not emphasize on different play-styles. soldier and heavy though feel too similar, with very few unique differences. Infiltrator feels like a technician in disguise (They're very similar).\n\n3. Vehicles (Special Units?)\nWhat would make the game incredibly interesting and fun is to have \"unique\" characters in the game, with slightly different alt to the class they have. A great example is you could have a sniper character in which his class is \"bounty hunter\" which would be a sniper class, with some unique scavenging perks. or getting bonuses at damaging specific units! This a passionate example ^u^\nVehicles, we have to cover this... the vehicles feels like a double-edged blade. In it self, it is a bigger unit which can do powerful attacks. They feel kind of lacking though, as that's where the line ends. they're units with stronger attacks and bigger hit-boxes, the main critic would be there's barely any special units like the phoenix project APC or Diciples of anu's mutated dogs. special units in the game form each faction are 3x3 grid big, it would be very interesting and diverse in play-style if 2x2 units were added (1x1 are regular units) to the game, they could be soldiers in mechsuits or a steed / a warthog with more inventory space (for example). 2x2 units would see lots of play as its perfect for balancing squads Surprisingly there aren't any ground vehicles with a light machine gun mounted in the game.\n\n4. Feedback\nWith all these comments i've made, they're only criticism! I don't hate or dislike the game, in fact this is the best game of mine in recent weeks since i got it! I fully support this game and all its efforts, and wish i could help them more seeing as this is a game , which may not be perfect, whom i believe have what it takes to reach perfection.", "timestamp_created": 1608845878, "timestamp_updated": 1608845878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83052389": {"recommendationid": "83052389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008410474", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 886, "last_played": 1610828510}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e35\u0e49\u0e22 \u0e44\u0e1b\u0e40\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\u0e17\u0e33 UI \u0e21\u0e32\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e2a", "timestamp_created": 1608828473, "timestamp_updated": 1608828473, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480158746242523193", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83041821": {"recommendationid": "83041821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036603218", "num_games_owned": 735, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 5885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5885, "last_played": 1608817586}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Everything I Hoped For [/h1]\nI saw this game when it launched its crowdfunding campaign and immediately backed it.  In my youth I was addicted to the original X-Com series.  Ive played many clones and games trying to be like that series always hoping for something close, and always being let down.  This game comes closest, while also being its own independent incredibly fun game.\n\nI love so many things about this game.  It has a vast tech tree, similar to the original X-Com but also allows you to branch into specific paths depending on the factions you choose to align with.  It has base building and resource management without being boring or tedious.  It even has its own form of timer, however NOTHING like the new X-Com game.  You have essentially as much time as you want to develop your teams, bases, research and equipment so long as you don\u2019t let the enemies overrun the planet.  You have character classes that as they level can branch into another class, so the combinations of skill trees and abilities makes for some fantastic team building options.  Don\u2019t like human legs and want to be able to jum?  Sure, just switch them out with the new cybernetic legs you developed.  Want a sniper who can also be a scout and see the enemy from far even in the dark?  Just mutate his head into the new special mutation you researched.  Honestly, this game has so much of what I loved in the old X-COM but is so enhanced.\n\nHonestly I don\u2019t have anything negative to say about this Phoenix Point.\n\n[b]Sound \u2013[/b] Everything you would expect.  Music is good, keeps the mood right.  Alien noises are great.  Sound effects simple and immersive.\n[b]Graphics \u2013[/b]  Great for what its trying to be.  Nothing cutting edge, but its not that kind of game.\n[b]Gameplay \u2013[/b] I covered it above.  Very fun.  I kept doing the \u201cOh just one more thing\u201d bleeding my hours away.\n[b]Replay Value \u2013[/b] There are multiple endings depending on the factions you align with, so definitely repayable especially if you enjoy uncovering the different endings.\n[b]Story \u2013[/b] Not a new concept to the genre, and between factions and exploration a lot of lore/story to discover.  Adds something to the game for sure.\n\nIf you ever played the old X-Com\u2019s or the new, and enjoyed them, you will love this.  If you like turn & squad-based combat with a team you can equip and design from the ground up, again you will love this.

There are many good bits, the aiming system, the hybrid classes, the factions, the technologies. But where the game succeeds in originality in its gameplay mechanics it fails in one very important area DIFFICULTY BALANCE and 'fairness'. \n \n\nGames like this should be played on ironman, choices should matter but the 'difficulty randomness' of Phoenix point makes this impossible. Some missions are a breeze others are literally impossible to succeed in forcing a restart  and the  loss often feels 'cheap' rather than a learning point (like in XCOM)\n\nDifficulty 'Randomness'\nI will give an example -  before writing this review I was playing a 'solider rescue' mission - by the second turn of the mission before it was even possible for me to reach the soldiers, they had both been killed- it was literally impossible to succeed. It is not possible to have a good experience unless you are willing to rely on save files and restarts to ensure a successful outcome\n\nNerfed Progression\nThe Campaign is also tedious and there is little that makes you feel like you are making meaningful progress or becoming more capable- you start the game overpowered- easily killing the pandorans in one shot and by the time you are 20 hours in with top level soliders and upgraded weapons it takes half the squad to take down the basic enemies and even basic missions (non campaign missions) can be near impossible to complete clean. Why would you make this design choice, it feels like the squad is becoming less capable as they advance, certainly not like the top ranked XCOM veterans. \n\nI really wanted to love Phoenix point, and there are moments where it shines but on balance it is a unbalanced frustrating and often tedious slog and after 50 hours invested  I may never finish the main campaign....even during lock down!  \n\nTime to go back to XCOM2 classic ironman difficulty!\n", "timestamp_created": 1608735666, "timestamp_updated": 1608735666, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.749222517013549805", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82965318": {"recommendationid": "82965318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008692494", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 143, "last_played": 1615394775}, "language": "english", "review": "Phoenix Point is effectively a crowd-funded, indie-game version of XCOM from the creator of the original XCOM game, Julian Gollop.\n\nWhile Phoenix Point lacks the big-budget slickness of the 2K/Firaxis XCOM reboots, I prefer it as a game.\n\nWhy?

Exceptions are ambushes and stopping attacks on the facilities of the other factions.  There a few other missions that appear that have to be responded to in a limited amount of time.\nThere are three other factions actively fighting the threat.  Each has many bases around the globe and a player's reputation can increase or decrease based on actions taken with factions as a whole and with individual bases.  The player can recruit soldiers from the different factions but the more important goal is to get a good enough relationship with one or maybe two of the factions so that their technology will be shared with the Phoenix Project.  At some points diplomatic missions must be undertaken in order to increase status with factions.\nImprovements in weapons technology are not dramatic in Phoenix Point.  Rate of fire, effective range and accuracy all have a part to play in selecting weapons.  Armor comes in three parts, helmet, torso and legs.  Weapons can be destroyed in combat by enemy fire and consumable items like grenades and ammunition must be replenished between missions.  The game makes this quite easy after each mission overall but some equipment must be picked up at a base after manufactured.  Items are not manufactured instantly.  \nUnits have far more hit points so it is not possible to wipe out all enemy units in an ambush  easily.  It is also possible to target individual sections of an enemy unit.  Over-watch is not 360 degrees and units have four action points that can be used in any order.  There are no pods in Phoenix Point and when a unit is discovered movement is stopped so a player can decide how to handle the situation, another difference from some other games of this type.  \nThere are many story line type missions since each faction has a series of missions to compete in order to gain influence with them.  Phoenix Point has a good variety of missions.\nPhoenix Point allows the player to have more than one base.  Bases are needed to detect alien complexes and for increasing manufacturing and research capabilities.  Base development requires a lot of resources which are tight in Phoenix Point.  \nIt is possible to have more than one aircraft and fighting vehicles.  \nResearch is tied to acquiring certain items, killing certain aliens or capturing them.  If influence with a faction becomes high enough then their research will be shared with the Phoenix Project.\nPhoenix Point will definitely scratch that strategic/tactical  itch.

One of them was steam, which came one year later. \nLeaving that aside, here are some thoughts on the game itself: \n\n1)  Strategic Map (geoscape)\n- poorly managed, it's tedious to locate your airplanes when you have more than 10, \n- base construction is stupid to say at the least. Some of my bases have completely blocked off tiles, to which you cannot reach. How about digging? This is also a stupid concept, that the building possibilities of a base are limited to 4x4 tiles. So the earth is so crowded that you do not have space anymore, or what? \nYou should be able to build as much as you please, each building adding the risk of being detected and attacked and the bigger the base, the more entry points it should have. Bigger bases also get attacked by larger forces, so THAT is a natural motivator for keeping your base small and efficient enough. \n- Exploring the map is useful at first, however after a while the locations do not present much interest anymore. As soon as you learn of all the havens, you concentrate on them. \n\n\n2) General concepts\n- manufacturing in a queue and nothing in parallel is just a simplification meant to make the devs jobs easier. Even the first x-com had a better grasp of production\n- research is poor... there's not much new stuff to research except haven's tech. Phoenix Point does get one or two good weapons, but too little too late. By the time you get the raven, the pondarans have so many mutations that you do not have any technological edge\n- soldier progression is very simplified in order to make the dev's life easier: \na) they can only increase their strengh, willpower or speed... First of all, those should be more or less fixed and perhaps trained. However stuff like accuracy, agility and others should also develop as you go or by training. \nb) you get random perks like a berserker gets the snipierist perk... You should TRAIN perks: nurture over nature -> reported during beta, ignored. \nc) at the endgame I have like 80 points for a soldier. Don't tell me that personal development is capped after a couple of years, humanity is just not THAT limited. \n- Transferring soldiers from one squad to the other must be micromamaged and it takes a lot of time\n- actually ALL aspects of strategic map has to be micromanaged, it's getting annoying in late \n\n\n\n3) Combat\n+ all in all, the combat is not that bad, it has some nice things, but it also has some very nasty bugs. \n- this Free camera is a nice idea, but very poorly implemented. Most of the times you do not see anything because of your own cover -> this was reported during beta phase and ignored\n- overwatch cone looked very good, it doesn't work\n- your sniper is standing behind cover and shooting his own cover -> reported during beta, not fixed. \n- your sniper is standing behind a teammate and you get friendly fire -> reported during beta, not fixed. \non the other hand, shooting at 2 tiles misses... come ooon!\n- vantage point for sniper counts for nothing... absolutely nothing\nBasically the game should avoid shooting stuff by mistake which is located 2-3 tiles near you. Any professional soldier can avoid shooting his own cover\n- enemy shooting back anytime you shoot at them is just stupid\n- defending base maps have whole corridors completely blocked, so if you have a vehicle in the base, sometimes you cannot use it to get anywhere near the invading forces\n- your vehicles destroy stuff in your own base as they drive... it was probably meant to be for \"effect\" but it's just stupid\n- spider drones just \"dissappear\" magically in some wall when launched\n- how the chance to hit is calculated, evades me, but you sometimes miss a target which didn't move in the last 3 turns with a sniper from a tower at a decent range, while hitting it with some other guy carrying a shotgun... \n- Missing a huge target like a scylla with a sniper is again a stupid concept. Big targets should usually be easier to miss. \n- I researched some thing which apparently makes my soldiers immune to virus attacks, I was so happy... well, in reality it doesn't work. \n\n\nThe only good things about this game are parts of the combat, however it is not worth the cash. We were expecting a better x-com. It's not!\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1608711386, "timestamp_updated": 1608711953, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500714898109436035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82938823": {"recommendationid": "82938823", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977068032", "num_games_owned": 506, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5305, "last_played": 1608802234}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoy the game, but the amount of tactical combat, ironically, can be too high sometimes. I frequently find myself queuing for three encounters in a row, which quickly gets repetitive (especially in the end-game, when there are usually 3-5 pending haven defense events, so at some point I just stop bothering). With this amount of encounters, the game doesn't let me spend nearly enough time on the global map, which also slows down any research and construction, making the game to progress extremely slowly. I realize it's a bit unorthodox and maybe defats the core gameplay purpose, but having auto-revolve mechanic for some battles would be really helpful to deal with the sheer amount of repetitive encounters, such as clearing nests and defending havens.\n\nOther than that, there are some balance issues, especially related to the antediluvian weapons. In fact, the entire Legacy Of the Ancients DLC doesn't fit the plot too well, ending up in a situation where we're looking for a proof about antediluvian existence AFTER having excavated their artifacts and even manufacturing their weapons. The weapons themselves are too overpowered and more or less easily obtainable, so by mid-game I have most of my troops carrying end-game weapons that don't even require ammunition. Most of the advanced weapons tech comes way later, and by then it makes no sense to research or manufacture them, because they are weaker and need ammo.\n\nDespite the abovementioned flaws, I've had my share of fun with the game and would like to thank the developers for making it!

I was very disappointed when it first released (unfinished, in my opinion).\nNow...its a work of art. I will say....I think its a deeper better design than XCOM.\nYes, I mean it and you can see how much I like XCOM from my game list hrs.\n\nThe things I think are magnificent in this game:\n1) the individuality of the characters. Simple color changes are awesome, but there is a good variation of heads (although the random generator selects more POCs and women than white males...a symptom of the \"woke\" craze right now), great selection of voices, and each character has random abilities....kind of like XCOM \"Long War\".\n\n2) The free aiming. Sure...the math is still there...behind the scenes, but hit chances are incredibly user friendly and they seem to make much more sense than XCOM..where you can stand right next to someone, shoot at 90+% and wind up missing. Not so much here. If the creature is next to you, you are pretty much guaranteed to hit it.\nPlus,. the animations are incredible with hit locations. LOVE the ability to target and hit specific locations....\n\n3) The world....its an apocalypse. There are multiple factions and you can TRADE!!! You can hire their soldiers. You can RAID and STEAL from them!!! They have personalities and are very different from each other.\n\n4) Graphics are gorgeous. I REALLY hopes this does well so we can get even more improvements!\n\n5) The voice acting and story-telling are awesome. Perhaps, XCOM is a higher production and so, one can say that the cutscenes and story are better. Still...for an \"indie\" game, its stellar.\n\nThings I dont like and wish could be improved:\n\n1) Bionics DLC. Lame. Not ONE of my soldiers have bionics. Its just not worth it. The options are spares, the STORY...is a travesty. What a HUGE disappointment with the ending of raiding the cyborgs. You dont even fight a big boss battle!!! LAAAAAAAMMMMMMMEEE!!!!!!!!!!\n\n2) I wish you could zoom into the scene better. The graphics and animations are so cool, its a shame the zoom is pretty fixed.\nThis also makes it hard to see the changes in mutants. They \"evolve\" through the game, but they still remain in \"TYPES\". Meaning a shield bearer may or may not have a gun. This particular thing is easy to spot, but not some of the other ones.\n\n3) Better base attacks. Right now, the mutants ALWAYS attack from one direction. Mix it up a bit!! Make some attacks worse than others. If there is a \"Citadel\" nearby, have a really bad incursion...things like that. MAYBE even have a team of another factor who have been mind-controlled? I dont know. Right now, its a bit boring.\n\n4) Sometimes, its hard to figure out how to get to the farthest regions...like Antarctica. Just a little more tweaking is needed, IMO.\n\nThat's it for now.

I love that, I loved that too in Phantom Doctrine. Random effect is the worst thing on xcom 2 tactical combat. What does it have with tactic anyway?

Be aware that the game uses different features and you can't always rely on old XCOM tactics.\n\nPhoenix Point has innovated the standard features you get in an XCOM-like game, while retaining the same spirit of the game. This cuts both ways; the new features sometimes increase risk and other time decrease it. \n\nI played >1000 hours of XCOM (combined) and had gotten stuck in a rut, using the same tactics based on certain game features. Phoenix Point changes its gameplay enough that it caused me to reevaluate my usual playbook.  \nOver all, it's a very good game if you're looking for an XCOM-like game and need a fresh take on gameplay features you're experienced with.\n\nAn overview of changed features relative to XCOM:\n\n* Gone are the hit chance percentages. All weapons have a bullet spread, and when you shoot, each bullet is randomized within the weapon's spread. The scenery blocks shots but can be destroyed in the process.\n* Similarly, cover does not grant a flatout percentage defensive chance. It's all about how visible your target is. Even in full cover and not flanked, an enemy that is close to flanking your unit is going to see most of your unit and have a good chance to hit. The game still shows you half/full cover icons but you have to use your brains: a handrail is obviously not going to block as many bullets as a waist-high rock.\n* Overwatch is conic. You get to choose the direction, distance and width of the overwatch cone. It allows you to focus overwatch on specific targets. But you can only have a 180\u00b0 field of view instead of XCOM's 360\u00b0.\n* Similar to Fallout's VATS, you can target limbs, heads, weapons, ... Disabling certain body parts confers certain debuffs on the enemy. Disabled legs lower movement speed, disabled arms prevent melee or wielding two-handed weapons, certain enemy abilities are disabled when the relevant body part is disabled.\n* Enemy AI is about as complex, but each enemy uses their own advantage better. The flanking units really scurry around and hide from sight, making it hard to take them out before they get to you.\n* Soldiers get skill points which can be invested in stat increases or the skill tree. There's a fixed class skill tree but each soldier also has a few personal randomized skills to choose from.\n* Soldiers can multiclass.\n* Geography matters for travel time and ability to respond to emergencies. You start building multiple bases across the globe, and you can build multiple ships and have multiple squads running around.\n* For the most part, technology unlocks are vertical. That is to say that new weapons are usually not flatout better, they just have different stats.\n* Consumables are consumed. The game makes it very easy to resupply your soldiers after every mission, but each ammo clip you empty or grenade you throw costs resources to resupply. By extension, soldiers need to carry ammunition if they want to reload.\n\nThere are some minor bugs and glitches, but they're mostly cosmetic. I have not encountered anything game-breaking.

Phoenix Point is what I had hoped the X-Com reboot would be.  It was a rare combination of nostalgia and new at the same time.  \n\nGame play felt extremely familiar, but in a good way, not the feeling of 'this again?\u2019  There are enough new gameplay elements to prevent it from seeming like you have already played the game, and the story is only similar on the surface.\n\nThe one part of the original X-Com that I missed, UFO interception, is already planned for the next DLC (which is free).\n\nEven at normal/standard game play level, the game is challenging (sometimes boarding on frustrating).  It took multiple play troughs in order for me to win a game.  And unless you like restarting battles and having lots of saves, expect to lose people.  Much like the original X-Com, it takes very little to cause the death of your troops.  If you hate troop loss this is probably not the game for you.\n\n\nReview @ 4.3 hours of game play\n\nThis game feels much more like the successor of the original X-COM series than the X-COM reboot.  I still have not experienced much of the game but what I have is good.

There are glaring issues with it.  If you are game developer and you are making a game that is very close to another on the market (XCOM in this case).  Then you need to at least meet the same quality of that game.   This doesn't happen here.\n\n-  Customization is terrible.  All you can do is change 2 colors and they are either drab or neon in tone.  Where XCOM has different helmets, goggles, armor etc..  Not.  When I played XCOM I used to color code and choose my accessories in a way that I would know what soldier is capable of.  Example:  Red & White = Medic.  You can't do that here.  Choose a color to represent your soldiers, that's it.\n\n-  Overwatch is soooo bad.  The game touts that each bullet has a separate trajectory and that each bullet has a calculation behind it.  I think that is great.   It's really good watching this in action as 100% of your bullets from an overwatch shot go straight into a solid object instead of the alien crossing your path.  This is because the overwatch zone is a cone of view centered off your soldiers current position.  Not like the floor tile system in XCOM which after 60 hours I now know is far better.    In real life, if I see a bad guy cross my overwatch zone, I don't unload all my bullets into the crate in front of him.  I wait for him to come from behind it, then begin shooting.\n\n-  Speaking of shooting into objects.   The AI can shoot through solid objects, and you cannot.  I've had every one of my bullets eaten by a railing, but the AI can shoot through a 4x4 bar support marked as hard cover with every bullet going through.  My other favorite sold object effect is with grenades.  You can have 3 aliens standing around tree planter, throw a nade into them, have the nade land dead center in the half height planter, aliens take NO damage.  Maybe the developers should watch a video on Youtube of what a grenade looks like when it blows up and then apply it to game mechanics.  \n\n- Just played a game where I was supposed to evac a VIP off the map.  Did this and all that was left was to evac my squad.  The VIP died off map.  MIssion failed.\n\n- Killed alien, respawns as dark alien, runs through entire squad of overwatch, doesn't trigger, 2 shots my sniper dead.   \n\nI have to give this game a NO recommendation primarily list for the above.  There are many other issues with the game.  Heavy class is practically useless for anything else than jet packing around to loot crates and shooting grenades.  What is the use of a class that can only move 4 squares and shoot, when the enemy can move 10-20 and then shoot.  Better to have a squad of all Assault troops who can do the same and fire farther, more accurately and more often.  Serious balance issues.\n\nThe game needs attention in basic mechanics, if this is not addressed, do not buy it.\n\nUninstalled.

I'm the guy who;\n\n-Got X-COM: Terror from the Deep as one of the two first games I owned on my PC in 1996\n-Have since played UFO: EU, Apocalypse, XCOM (2012) and XCOM2, in addition to one of the open source UFO games.\n-Of those games, the one that stands out for me as the series at its best is XCOM2 (vanilla). The others are, to my mind, all similarly flawed.\n\nBut enough about me, let's talk about Julian Gallop, the man on whose name this game was sold. See Julian was responsible for the original XCOM (and Apocalypse), and since XCOM is strategy royalty and the series has been in a bit of a rut since XCOM2, who better to reinvigorate the genre?\n\nLet's be clear. Phoenix point is XCOM. It's a cover-based, turn-based shooter where your team of marine-types fight of scores of alien creatures, whilst also managing bases and researching the alien menace to progress. I would assume that if you're reading this, you know XCOM and are simply asking where this sits in the list of best XCOM games.\n\nPhoenix Point continues the tradition of XCOM games being b-movie stories. If the modern XCOM games choose the ass-kicking scientists trope, Phoenix point prefers a slightly more nerdy approach. The plot is there, but after a bit I started skipping the new plot sections. I doubt anyone would be glued to their seat in awe of the badly scripted and acted scenes, but they are there to provide some context to the carnage. What I will say is that following WotC's assertion that Alien's are basically Orcs who got lost on the way back from the last Shadow of Mordor design, it is pleasant to see aliens that once again look alien.\n\nSo what does Phoenix point bring to the table that XCOM doesn't? The key differential is the \"realistic ballistic\" mechanic. Realistic is probably a stretch, but rather than the simple percentage chance to hit, you now have a crosshair based system where all shots land inside the outer circle and 50% will land inside the inner. I suspect the inspiration for this all the times your soldier in XCOM had been stood next to an enemy and inexplicably decided to fire straight up into the sky. The other idea is that with each bullet in a burst calculated individually, you are less prone to XCOM's bullshitometer. Phoenix point is a world where you work on 50% of the potential damage output and anything else is a bonus. By and large the above system actually works very well, and though the bullshitometer is very much present, at least I'm missing by a hair rather than a point on the compass.\n\nThe other thing that has changed is the tactical map. XCOM's floating base - which a lot of long-term fans found quick reductionist - is gone, and we are back to the Terror From the Deep world of multiple bases to cover multiple areas. Although even by TFtD's standards this has been cranked up heavily. I suspect you would need something like 30 different bases to cover the globe. That isn't a requirement necessarily, but if you are the completionist those are the figures that you're looking at.\n\nThis is a major theme in the design of Phoenix Point; the idea that \"less is more\" is wholly untrue, and in fact \"more is more.\" How would you like five different types of shotgun, all with their own strengths and weaknesses? 10 alien unit types? Pfft. Phoenix point has well over 40! Three factions (more with dlc) to either ally or antagonise. Several different quest lines. A huge research tree. The works. For the people who were disappointed that the modern XCOM's scaled back so many of these features it reads list a wishlist.\n\nAs the adage goes, though, be careful what you wish for.\n\nMy first issue with Phoenix point is that the interface has a clunkiness to it that really seems like bad design. It is epitomised by the manufacturing screen, where you can sort items by the soldier's class, but not by item type. So to go back to those five shotguns you will need to memorise each detail and scroll up and down through the rest of the items to view each one. It makes comparison a pain in the arse, and I'm not sure why it was excluded.\n\nThe next issue is that for all the choice to have 40 odd aliens, the reality is that most are copy-paste reskins with boosted stats. The simple reality is that there are very few that create a true sense of fear when they arrive on the map. I didn't always like the art design in XCOM2 but there was no doubt that when a Muton/Crysalid/Gatekeeper showed up for the first time it was always a brown pants moment. Phoenix Point only really has one of those, the mind controlling, will-sapping Zerg-like shitbag. The game also tells you at the start of each month that you'll be facing new enemies and gives you a breakdown on each one. Call me a traditionalist, but would it be more dramatic to discover these threats in battle rather than in a small pamphlet?\n\nThere are technically more variation in the classes in Phoenix point, including the option to multi-class (which most soldiers will inevitably do). Yet when I compare the choices on offer to that of XCOM:EU or XCOM2, most powers feel a lot less dramatic. They have also done away with the rank system, and instead gone for simple character levels, which is a bit disappointing. The de facto best way to level up those characters is to buy training centres and just leave them in the HQ, which isn't really in the spirit of things. Customisation is very much a tertiary concern, but Phoenix Point is much more limited than XCOM and also seems to have some very, very odd ideas about what hair looks like. I'm also still scratching my head why I can't rename and customise the two characters from the prologue, who have contributed absolutely nothing to the story at any point since.\n\nYet these issues are but minor ones, and Phoenix Point could still be a great game in spite of them. It isn't, of course, and that is because of the next issue.\n\nIt is exactly the same problem that UFO:EU had, that Terror from the Deep had, and that XCOM Apocalypse had, but it's somehow even worse here. See all those games were characterised by Julian's approach to game design: Take a good idea, make the game expansive and then slowly drive the player off by making them engage in the same process an ungodly amount of times. The XCOM games I mentioned at the start - only the modern games I completed. I didn't fail to complete the early ones because I couldn't, I chose not to complete them because after a while they became repetitive and dull. XCOM:EU and XCOM2 don't get everything perfect but they have gone to great lengths to make ensure that you're stuck in these traps that plagued the old games.\n\nEventually in Phoenix point you will expand to have bases on 3-4 continents. At this point the game falls apart on itself because it feels like that should be headway, but at that point - the point I am at right now - the Haven and base attacks are so frequent that I don't have time to do the main quest. Yet these haven attacks are directly tied to a failstate of the world's population, so I have to get involved. Even more frustratingly, the transport aircraft presumably have an elaborate holographic device that creates the illusion of jet propulsion instead of the propellers they must actually be using in order to get anywhere that slowly. My troops were in my base in the western US. My base in China got attacked, but I had 24 hours notice. The craft could not get there in time.\n\nPhoenix point quickly descends into the standard Gallop slog. If you liked the original XCOM games, carry on.

I would have bought it the day it came out but they pulled the 1 year epic exclusive crap. I refuse to put that launcher on my pc. I've done about 2 play throughs but I have only beat it once on veteran. First one I lost bad because I was still learning. I am a die hard XCOM fan. I've played the original xcom on PS1 for gods sake. I had to download an emulator for terror from the deep because this was before steam had it. I have apoc but never got into it. I beat xcom reboot and put over 1k hours into XCOM 2+WOTC because of the awesome modding community. I have mixed feelings about Phoenix Point. I for one hated how the creator back stabbed the donators by selling his soul to EPIC. I'm glad I waited the year for the release because I heard the game was very buggy at launch. Which makes me question \"Hey. All those millions of dollars EPIC paid you to release your game on their platform. If it's this broken at release just how much of that money went into the game?\"\n\nThe geoscape. Feels like it's more play your way instead of playing how the game wants you too. Keeping nations happy for supplies, no thanks. In PP(lol) your mostly left to your own devices. Which can feel overwhelming at first but is nice once you get the hang of it. The pit stop mechanic feels wrong though. There have been times where I didn't do missions because I couldn't get there. The Pure's fortress was in Australia for me and I had nothing near there. By the time I got a ship with a far enough range to raid the place the entire country was wasted.\n\nI love how you can aim at specific body parts instead of a hit %. I really hated in XCOM how you can fire a shotgun point blank into a muton with 98% and miss! I love shooting things in the arms to disable their weapons ect. I also love that I don't need a target to fire. If someone is hiding behind a wall I can try to punch a hole in the wall. I could do that in the original XCOM and I missed that feature.\n\nTheir version of overwatch is better than XCOM and worse at the same time. It was good to be able to point where I wanted the soldier to shoot. However that wasn't enough. Several enemies crawl. Your soldiers will take shots at them even if it is impossible to connect a shot. My biggest issue with overwatch was the fact the enemies are still moving when a shot is taken. I've had 5 people pointing at one guy. When the first 2 finished their shots the little bastard had ran past the other 3 and killed someone. Forcing me to restart the mission. It would be nice if the enemy moved a bit slower when being shot at or my troops fired a bit faster.\n\nNot enough mission types. Mostly I'm protecting havens or doing a scavenging missions. Those got old real quick. I like the base defense missions but it would have been nice to actually have facilities to help you with those defenses. Eventually I ran out of points of interest and it felt like I was only doing haven defense missions majority of the game. When I completed the game I checked my stats and I had done over 6 scavenging missions, 2 soldier rescues, 6 base defense missions, 4 ancient ruin defense, 19 nests, 12 lairs, 5 citadels and over 60 haven defense missions. That gives you an idea of what you will be doing most of this game.\n\nBase layout was dull. There was no real reason to think about how you build your bases. No thought process on what to build or where to put it. Except for 1 base that was basically a farm, all my other bases where exactly the same. There is a reason to build multiple bases, which reminds me of the old xcom. However each base feels so dull and like it's there so you can reach other areas. In the old XCOM I had several defense facilities I could construct. If I had enough a UFO was destroyed before it landed. Preventing the need to defend the base at all.\n\nNot enough enemies. I do love how they evolve and adapt to what your doing but it just felt like there wasn't enough types. Their version of a heavy, assault and berserker was the exact same enemy. Just with different armor and weapons. Some enemies had really cheesy mechanics. I hated Umbras. I really disliked how a siren can walk a country mile, mind control someone then walk another mile to get behind a structure. Making it impossible to hit her.\n\nClasses. I like and hate the fact you can mix classes. Some combinations are amazing. Like snipers with rage burst or techs who can toss turrets straight from their inventory. However I felt the classes alone were not enough. It's like they knew you would combine 2 classes so they gave us 2 halves to make 1 whole. Some classes flat out need a specific sub class to function. Like the berserker. I felt I needed to train them in assault for dash so they could get into melee range. The Priest class was cool but it feels very weak compared to the Psi Operatives I'm used too from WOTC. Once a squad got maxed out I lost a little interest in battles because there was nothing more to learn.\n\nI like the 3 factions. Their backgrounds, the fact we can trade with them, share research, steal stuff from them. A nice touch. I did feel a little overwhelmed at times when multiple havens were being attacked at once. I like how we can appease to all of them but once they start fighting each other, it felt like being ashamed to be a human. Couldn't we at least wait till after we wiped out Pandora before turning on each other? If I start another play through I plan to raid them more so I can get a better start.\n\nThe aircraft. I felt like the generic manticore is the best aircraft. Fits enough people and goes pretty fast. The New Jericho helicopter plane had more room but it's slower than manticore. The synedrion plane was quick but could only fit 5 people. The Anu blimp has the most space but it was so damn slow I regret stealing it. When I found out how slow it was I wanted to give it back. I had a starting position in South America. When I expanded to North America I moved my blimp up north. Some missions ended before it even got there. I had to send it back south and move the manticore up there.\n\nI liked the various research trees. Different weapons for different play styles. Certain factions offer different research. It didn't feel like a linear path compared to xcom. Unlock laser/gauss weapons first, get armor then go straight to plasma weapons. \n\nThe story is gripping me. Similar to XCOM but different enough to be it's own thing and I love the lovecraftian take on it. I would have enjoyed some actual CG cut scenes instead of still pictures. The voice actors were average but they didn't have any names I recognized. My biggest issue with the story is multiple endings. I don't have a problem with that but how to get them. Making max research with a faction unlocks their final mission. Which is essentially the same as the final battle except the ending is different. Researching the Phoenix solution forces you to take their ending.\n\nI despise the ancients DLC. The hoplites are annoying as #@$% with their shields. I have multiple sites and I still can't find the one that lets me craft the weapons and it's more crap to protect. I couldn't find all the manufacturing sites.\n\nThe cover system feels crappy. I felt despite being in cover enemies could still hit me pretty regularly. I had a heavy with a robotic augment that gave him a shield. They had zero trouble shooting him in the head -.- It almost reminded me of playing Gears of War 5. When playing horde on Master difficulty. Even if you are in cover they can still hit you. It's just flat out better to block line of sight then to be in actual cover.\n\nLast the final mission. First half is fun but the 2nd is really bad. You will know when you see it.\nOverall if you like xcom this game is alright. Has some things I wish xcom had and vice versa. Get it when it's on sale though.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1608483431, "timestamp_updated": 1608483431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.725927233695983887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82771110": {"recommendationid": "82771110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198930221540", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1533, "last_played": 1608762801}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game", "timestamp_created": 1608482491, "timestamp_updated": 1608482491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506696403026580811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82769995": {"recommendationid": "82769995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050866761", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 19539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6328, "playtime_at_review": 860, "last_played": 1619268025}, "language": "english", "review": "greatgame", "timestamp_created": 1608481299, "timestamp_updated": 1608481299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506696403026580811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82754511": {"recommendationid": "82754511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012295041", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2001, "last_played": 1608478218}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is amazing fit for anyone that is a fan of xcom series.

If you found the lack of strategic layer a flaw in the Firaxis games, then Phoenix Point will give you more to do, although don't count on it being very complex. Technology progression is more of a web with more subtly defined power level progression. For instance, the enemies will develop armor plating, but you can get weapons that have more armor penetration.\n\nThe setting is more interesting, but again, don't expect anything ground breaking. The overall production value is nice but is clearly outproduced by Firaxis' much bigger development budget. Overall, the game's technical details are passable.\n\nIs it a solid recommendation? No, but it's still worth playing, especially if you found XCOM2 to be lacking in that open decision space that players of the original X-Com games enjoyed.

And yes, I'll be comparing the two because more than likely if you're getting phoenix point it's because you like XCOM. Phoenix Point ads complexity in some ways that are, in theory, nice additions. Controlling the range of your Overwatch so you take better shots is the best feature with nothing to complain about. Splitting your actions into 4 per turn that can be used in any order is nice, but movement in PP is so poor that it often feels like you can do less than in XCOM.  The option to build multiple aircrafts and bases is good in theory, bogged down by the game's poor handling of resource management. And then it's downhill from there, with a dozen different damage types, resources that don't clearly portray their availability or use, and various mechanics that aren't clear. Finally, the attempt at a VATS knockoff falls flat, as most enemies either die fast enough that there's no point in limb crippling, or have so much HP and armor per limb that you're better off just focusing down their head or torso for the kill.\n\nThe game boasts 7 classes, but 4 of them are only available through the other factions. Multiclassing is an option. Most skills are very boring and direct in their usefulness. Ultimately, the Heavy and Assault classes felt horribly inferior to Snipers, so the game became about whether you wanted snipers with more horizontal or verticle mobility. \n\nIn a vacuum, the enemy designs are good, but it gets samey very fast. In XCOM, while a few enemies are upgraded versions of weaker ones with a slightly different look, at 20 hours in all enemies look like one of only a handful or variations.\n\nTL;DR Phoenix Point is XCOM with more ideas than good gameplay.

Worth the asking price.  A steal on sale.\nWhat are you getting for your money?   An enjoyable game with turn based battles and a decent story.\nWhat aren't you getting?  X-com.   THIS IS NOT X-COM.  \n\nI've played all the X-Coms, and while I enjoyed them, the big combat maps ( especially in X-com 2 ) could drag on and on.  Maps are smaller in Phoenix Point.  Enemies have their own agenda - sometimes they are gathering supplies,  sometimes destroying buildings, sometimes killing citizens. sometimes gathering intelligence. \n\nIt gives a nice variety to the game.  And that's the area where Phoenix Point shines - in its variety.  Land on an \"explore area\" and you could wind up with a text encounter that yields supplies, faction, or moral choices.  Or you could get ambushed by raiders, or critters, or one of the three factions. \n\n You can help the in game factions or choose to raid them yourself.  Why build an aircraft when you can steal it? \n\nIn some ways the game improves on the X-com series.  You can always choose to \"free aim\" . This brings up a targeting ring with two areas - an inner area and an outer ring. Bullets will always land somewhere within the two ( unless they hit an object on the way to the target ). \nNo more RNG miss madness.  If you aim center mass and both targeting areas are on the target, you are going to hit something.  You may not hit the little squishy body part that fills only part of the two rings - but you will hit something inside those two rings.  Specific body parts have specific functions.  Wound a leg and the enemy will move slower.  Blow off a giant, pointy arm and that hulking creature can no longer stab you with it.  The targeting and \"real balistics\" are a great improvement over X-com .  \n\nEven though it's not X-com, there are still some traditional X-com moments.  Don't have time to use the front door?  Blow a hole in the back wall and charge in to rescue a citizen from hot alien death.\n\nTactically, your starting squad is fairly weak on skills and abilities.  As they level up, your combat options expand.  One great feature is that your heavy weapon user starts out with a jet pack.  Swoop down on an enemy and bash them to death with your auto cannon  ( this is pretty much a necessity because firing your auto cannon takes three of your four action points but bashing only takes one ) . \n\nA plus - or minus depending how you view such things - is the presence of a \"doom timer\".   If the human population falls under a certain percentage, it's game over.  If the \"skull bar\" fills up fully...  not sure what happens, hasn't happened yet, but probably nothing good.   What it boils down to is that time is not your friend.  Enemies continually get stronger and have improved skills.   A red fog of infection spreads inexorably over the map.   If a constant sense of doom or the unfairness of alien infestation excites you, then Phoenix Point is what you are looking for.\n\nSome players have experienced bugs.  I haven't come across any.  The game has been very stable for me.  \n\nIs Phoenix Point  X-com or X-com plus ?  No.  And that's not a bad thing.

For the most part, I was unsuccessful.  There are some things here that work, but lots more that don't.  \n\nIn some ways, the game is very concerned with being \"realistic\"; eg. the \"realistic bullet physics\". The idea sounds promising, but it doesn't play out well.  Aiming for body parts is often a trivial decision, or a non-decision.  Often your shot/throw gets blocked by a random terrain feature that was impossible to see/plan for.  In reality, often you could work around these obstacles - you could lean over a little bit, or throw your grenade on a different trajectory.  Here, you're just randomly screwed.  \n\nI remember when XCOM 2012 came out and a few people were disappointed that each gun didn't have its own ammunition.. turns out that was a good idea.  PP lets you waste your time buying and scrapping 100 different ammo types, clogging up the crappy UI, and never gives you any gameplay payoff for doing so.  XCOM lets you have some custom ammo types - but at the cost of a scarce equipment slot which makes for an actual interesting choice, unlike any of your inventory decisions here (which are basically non-existent, as you normally have tons of slots/weight to give).   Equipment is mostly lame, with way too many variants of very similar weapons.  You very rarely get the satisfying feeling of a \"next generation\" weapon upgrade like you do in XCOM (moving to laser/plasma/whatever).\n\nThe level design is just terrible.  The maps are bland and repetitive.  You spend a ton of time slowly crawling over empty distances, especially when the map has one enemy left that you can't find.  It took me a half hour to find a stupid worm in a pit once.  The levels are full of overhangs/squigglies that block vision and hinder gameplay in random/tedious ways.  \n\nMission difficulty is all over the map; some \"story\" missions were bizarrely easy, some were fine, some were easy but with \"traps\" you had to work around (or bad random setups that you just wanted to reroll).  In general the difficulty is too low, but spikes to \"very frustrating\" (eg. the orichalcum shield ancients, or the final boss), especially if your strategy doesn't line up well with the arbitrary, unpredictable mechanics of the mission (which you then solve by reloading/re-equipping: fun!).\n\nThere aren't many \"real\" enemy types, and what's there is super bland.  The enemy evolution feels arbitrary/meaningless, and doesn't pay off in interesting decisions or gameplay.  I paid no attention to whether something was a Arthron Spork Wimpleclip or a Arthron Wankle Splink Engine.  The only gameplay difference they made was whether they had a shield and/or a gun.  The variety of enemies in XCOM is one of the core reasons that game was great, and one of the core problems with PP is how bland the enemies feel.\n\nThe AI in XCOM 2012 was reasonably simple and predictable, making the game a contest between your superior tactics vs. their superior power/numbers.  That worked out fine, it's a perfectly workable design.  It's not necessary for your opponents to be tacticians - but it would also be OK if they were.  Instead, the AI here is mega-random.  Sometimes enemies dodge around 3 layers of overwatch to have every enemy on the map focus fire one of your dudes (which makes you shrug and re-load).  Other times a strong enemy (eg. a Siren) runs out in front of 4 of your people and does nothing.  Just waits to die a completely unsatisfying death.  \n\nYour tactics against this random level of opposition tend to end up in one of two directions: you play ultra-cautious and tediously crawl around the map... or just save every turn and YOLO around every corner.  Neither is fun.  I really missed the perfectly implemented timed missions of XCOM 2, where you had to balance out caution and speed.  Or the terror missions.  Most missions here have no timer, and the equivalent of the terror missions still generally just feel like \"kill all enemies\".\n\nI much prefered playing XCOM 2 on Ironman mode; here the randomness would make that very ill advised.  I imagine most people save scum pretty hard.  That's lame, and drains the game of tension - but it'd be way too frustrating to play PP that way (even the \"tips\" pretty much tell you to save often).  One of the great mechanics in recent XCOM games were how injuries predominated over deaths.  You paid a penalty for taking big hits - people wouldn't be available for some time so you'd have to rotate through people - but you could reasonably muddle through.\n\nHere, you can lose a few people randomly (and permanently) in an instant (especially to the stupid \"umbras\", which are a huge random difficulty spike in lots of otherwise easy missions).   So when you lose people, you reload.  That trains you to see losing people as unavoidable, irrelevant, random, and tension-free.  Ran around a corner with no actions left and died?  Who cares, you just reload.\n\nPP does have an injury/stamina system, but it rarely came into play for me.  Serious injuries are rare - usually people just die if they get caught out, and otherwise you heal up with medpacks (which means they're instantly ready to go for next mission, bad design decision here) - so you never feel the same pressure to rotate through members.  You just wait at base until everyone's healed up, then go out again.  The game loses a significant source of interesting decisions (which is a theme with many of the design decisions here).\n\nThe upgrades are lame.  XCOM gave you choices of which branch to take - and often you wanted to take both because they were strong and interesting.  But having to pick one was an interesting decision, and meant your people (even of the same class) felt different as they took different choices.  Here, you can dual class and eventually get every upgrade for a character.  This makes your soldiers feel bland and samey.  The upgrades themselves are rarely interesting, with a lot of slots that are just stat boosts or generic abilities (eg. Dash, which you'll get on everyone who can take it).  The one interesting tactic I found (rapid clearance + melee weapon discount, meaning you could easily kill 20 enemies in a turn with one character, especially if you had 4 allies standing around donating action points) felt mega stupid, completely outclassed comparable strategies, and was completely at odds with the tone the game is aiming for.   \n\nI could spend another few paragraphs talking about how much I hate the geoscape, how tedious it is to jet around putting out fires, and in general how the decisions you make in base building/flying around are less interesting than the equivalent decisions in XCOM.   The research tree was bland, and I never felt I was making an interesting decision about what to get next.  It's very easy to get too many research stations and have nothing left to research (because it's all locked behind Ally garbage).. that felt lame and against theme.\n\nOverall... I have endless more complaints and I'm tired of writing.  I feel like lots of design decisions here were guided by weird \"principles\" or something, choosing (arbitrarily defined) \"realism\" and \"ideas that sounded clever when we were getting started\" over \"whatever decisions makes for an interesting game\".  Over the whole 40 hours (or whatever) I played, I very rarely felt anything other than \"glad I don't have to do that mission again\".  \n\nIf this was the first entry in a new genre (like Enemy Unknown was in 199X) this would seem like a promising game with a bunch of great ideas.  Instead, it's running against a vastly, vastly improved version of itself (in the form of XCOM2, especially with the DLC) - and that makes all of its flaws, shortcomings and outright failings visible in very sharp contrast.", "timestamp_created": 1608415103, "timestamp_updated": 1608415800, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48598131537437439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82712656": {"recommendationid": "82712656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067363111", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1588, "last_played": 1608410500}, "language": "english", "review": "My first ever negative review!\nI've encountered a bug that tends to happen in almost every tactical battle after a certain point, where the enemies take 5 minutes doing nothing before taking any action.

Instead of a percentage you take aim and have 2 rings, around half your shots will land in the inner ring and all of your shots will land inside the outer ring forcing you to think about angles and what exactly you are aiming at. Oddly this mechanic is not taken farther with the concept of aimed shots (Higher action point cost for smaller ring) to vary your tactical options. Riot shields are also added for both you and the enemy and this works very well with the new aim mechanic. The concept of having to explore locations on the world map for missions and resources is also nice and the story is decent.\n\nThe Bad:\nUnfortunately just about everything else is wrong with this game. The difficulty curve even on the lowest setting is insane. Anyone that has played XCOM Enemy Unknown/Within knows it is possible at least on the lower settings to not lose a single nation or soldier and win. Good luck with that with Phoenix Point. By the end of the first in game month The enemy has received at least a dozen upgrades while there are literally no true upgrades to be had for your forces. I am not really even sure what the point of research in this game is considering there is so little to research. There is also the fact that equipping soldiers costs a small fortune per soldier and takes days to produce the equipment. This is not helped by the fact by the end of the game your people might as well be made of paper and you have to split your squads across the world. You will NEVER be ahead of the game when it comes to having equipment or manpower. There is also the fact there is no real way to protect the populations in havens because even if you do manage to keep the infected and raiders off of them they do not produce any food and starve to death for some reason leaving me wondering why I am even bothering, The range on your transport is also painfully short making travailing to new hot spots extremely time consuming and difficult. What makes all of this together so annoying is they really could have followed the XCOM formula here and come out with a very good game\n\nOver all I do not recommend it as the bad far outweighs the good.

On one hand the game is a great tactical turn based sim -- but on the other hand it's a busy mess that punishes more than it praises. Victories bring little reward while failures are crushing and brutal. One mechanic in most of Xcom's iterations (and spiritual successors like Phoenix Point) have in common is a research tree that allows you to take your victories and shift the balance of power back in your favor. Enemies have deadly weapons? Kill them and reverse engineer them. Powerful new aliens arrive? Research powerful new weapons. In Phoenix point it seems like this would be the case too -- but the better guns never arrive. You start out against a foe more than fairly matched with the initial evolutions of your foe being easy to knock over, but they rapidly get every advantage you do, plus a whole lot more and they just get harder and harder without the player (despite a complex research tree and factions to share research) giving you anything that really helps you overcome your enemy much less turn the tide. The closest to a weapons breakthrough I was given was a powerful but woefully inaccurate cannon weapon but even that got outstripped by the endless march of the armor and size of the opponents you face. The game gave me resources I didn't even know how to use or have an avenue to utilize, and had numerous \"artifact\" resources I only learned how to find by the time it was too late. You can never have enough men to cover all your bases, and unprotected bases if raided are totally destroyed making it economically unfeasable to restore them to functioning. There are lots of different craft to choose from to move your squads, but the ones that allow you to move big squads are too slow, and the fast ones don't move enough troops into an engagement to win. You'll only be able to maintain about 1.5-2.5 good squads of troops, and losing anyone will be devastating forcing you to save scum (though I consider this standard in the genre) ... what is NOT standard is how 1-2 squads simply cannot get done what is called for to be done and that's all you get. When I hit the \"Wall\" I had as stated only two squads/vehicles, and the map was COVERED in plot advancing quests on the other side of the earth Where it took forever to get to and back from, with multiple havens getting raided at the same time. You inexplicably don't pick up most of the guns off the people you kill forcing you to spend/waste resources restocking after every mission and frankly it's a losing battle even keeping your troops supplied. A good metaphor for this game is a 4-star meal served to you with fine presentation only to learn your silverware is the size of toothpicks and the bites of the food are huge and you're incapable of cutting them into manageable pieces until the waiter starts grinding your face into your meal by stomping on the back of your head with a combat boot and as you slowly lose consciousness things start to get REALLY mean. \n\nSeriously -- I felt like I had access to scores of weapons in my playthrough -- but none of them were effective against the aliens. Shotguns that promised to do deadly damage at close range PINGED off of mid-late game enemies armor. Only sniper weapons and unwieldy cannons seemed to harm foes AT ALL, with opponents cleaning your friggin' clock with comparatively similar weapons... because your armor isn't nearly as broken as the aliens.\n\nThe faction dynamic in this game is really flavorful and dare I say cool on the surface, but it boils down to a ridiculous game of \"three-stooges\" with all of humanity on the brink of extinction and each faction being more absorbed with hurting each other over conflicting ideals than fighting the monsters that are LITERALLY EATING THEM. It's like a synedrion scientist would be getting devoured from the waist down by an alien while he is ordering you to sabotage a New Jericho factory for reasons that are completely unexplainable. \n\nHumanity is in the same boat, but everyone is bailing water into each others parts of the rowboat, with predictable results. It looked like there was plenty of game left when I stopped playing because like I said, it just kept getting more and more brutal. It ended for me when I finally faced an alien that was as big and armored as several vehicles with a health meter to boot, that pooped aliens that mind controlled your characters and if you even grazed it would put up a smoke screen to hide it -- and there I was looking at the same damn toothpicks and inaccurate cannons to take it on. \n\nI gave up, unwilling to waste another 40 hours to hit the wall again because even with everything I learned in that long of playing a campaign I didn't see hope in trying again with knowledge and optimization. If I were you, I'd move on, and give up in advance. If you want a good Xcom game play the actual Xcoms or try PHANTOM DOCTRINE which is a refreshing departure from the genre, instead.

(9 slots)- not so bad unless you're on a mission where you need to raid and horde items.\n\n-You must manage ammo for each trooper. If they don't have ammo, you must produce them or they're useless. If you have low supplies, you're SoL and must postpone and trade for supplies. Not great if your mission is time sensitive.\n\n-You can't just go down the research tree like you could with Xcom. At some point in time you'll hit a dead end and need to steal research from another group or ally. (While each of the other three factions is killing each other and whittling down the total human population) your weapons and ammo are still the same sets you started with.\n\n-Free aim, with the ability to target body parts sounds incredibly interesting. What it really means is that you're shooting with the accuracy of a spit ball across a football field unless you're really close. Why not get closer? Because enemies will punish you if you let them get close with double or triple attacks, knocking your guys to 20% health unless you waste an action to heal them. You might get a chance to shoot if you didn't move. But guess who else is there? The monster that double/tripper attacked you in the first place.\n\n-When another settlement is under attack, they don't tell you until the settlement is at least 50% dead, which means unless you have a local base on that continent, you're probably screwed.\n\nAll of these make missions an incredible struggle, which honestly makes things more difficult than they are fun.\n", "timestamp_created": 1608188755, "timestamp_updated": 1608188755, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517567574977874756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82540825": {"recommendationid": "82540825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035396144", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2866, "last_played": 1611434416}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot like xcom but with a far better aim system and a lot of extra comlexity/clunkyness in the UI.

Each bandit had 4 shots, and there were 4 bandits. Each round of this simple battle took 4-5 minutes on the enemy acting alone. I tried to stick it out and the next mission had me on a base defense, except only half the aliens advanced. the rest waited for me to find them in the corners of the large map. \n\nThe camera is pretty annoying.

No fog of war so you don't know where your soldiers can see and not. This is a big deal, I need that info. I cant see behind walls in real life so when monsters just pop up because I had to assume I could see behind a corner its incredibly frustrating. \nThere are apparently places with fog of war so the technology to have that is there. I wouldn't know though I gave up before that, and its not the norm and no mods/options to change anything about it which is weird because there's like 3 DLCs out already and a 4th one is on its way.\n\nThe strategy part takes forever because it insists of locking the camera to the soldier you're moving and showing you how they run to where you told them to go. It feels incredibly slow. Even the original X-com had tricks to speed up sending soldiers from A to B. \nI don't need to watch my guy run to see what a good job he did reaching where I told him to go, speed that shit up if you have to show me that or give me the option to do so at least. Now I have to watch people accelerate, run for 4-5 seconds and then de-accelerate and get into position 4-5 times per turn.\nXenonauts did this right, your guy will be where you tell him to be, and he will walk there and you're free to keep assigning orders in the meantime. if he runs into an alien he will stop and alert you. \nGoing from that to how Phoenix Point handles things feels like a step back. I mean - it LOOKS cool, the game has really nice graphics and animations but the information provided is not important.\n\nThe cover system is also annoying. I thought it would make the game deeper but it just makes it feel more shallow somehow. Everybody is running around to get inside of cover/get into the enemies cover. I don't like it and that's a core feature.\n\nIt's incredibly hard to get an overview of how the battle scene is and after a while I just ended up with the good old \"pixel hunting\" with my mouse, looking square by square at which square be the best square to move to in the case of having cover/being able to shoot the enemy instead of actually looking at area. \nI would say that relying on this information is a crutch for a fundamentally flawed system. I think I would have prefered just some kind of matrix version where I would just be able to see that info at all times. It feels like the \"real world\" graphics that is not a bunch of lines telling you where safe is is just cosmetics. It's really annoying. The battle scape has too much information and too little information at the same time if that makes sense.\n\nIt's a weird decision because I saw a game designer for X-com 2 say they scrapped this design because of the reason I just mentioned. You don't look at the world, you look at where the lines are the most optimal.\n\nThere's a lot I can say about the game but the reason it hurts is because I know there is a great game in there but its being held hostage of these for me horrible mechanics. It's possible it's not my kind of game but I don't know who would enjoy this.\n\nI wanted to \"get\" the combat so I could finally enjoy the game, but the only way apparently is to just \"keep playing until you get it\". I'm all for \"git gud\", I love punishing games but in this case I just feel like there's a huge mountain of actual frustration, not challenge to get over and I gave up. Everything is so vague and the combat is so \"loose\", the more I learned about it the less I wanted to play.\n\nThe game seems to know this as well because combat early on (my only point of reference) is extremely easy and I feel that also holds me back from learning how to play it. None of my choices matter really. I tried to play as strategically as I could, trying to learn the new cover system but it only ended up with me feeling that I wasted time because when I would just run up to the baddies and blast them in the face point blanc they died all the same and I had to spend less time being forced watching my guys run.\n\nPermadeath is an awesome mechanic but you are going to have to punish me at some point for doing something wrong so I can learn and get a feel for how to play the game. Reading guides etc still just give me the tip \"get a feel of how to play\" and if that's the best a game that's been out for one year can give me then I'm sorry the battle design is just too vague.\n\nIt took me on average 6 hours of studying up on how to play the game, and this is by alt-tabbing and preparing by late night watching youtube videos about \"how to play to be able to enjoy the game\".\n\nEventually I I just cut my losses and played another game of Xenonauts instead.\n\nIt just hurts because I would love to like this game so much but theres just so many things you just \"have to get over\" for me that I will never enjoy the awesome things I really hope future games take inspiration from.", "timestamp_created": 1608114083, "timestamp_updated": 1608114906, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.816838264465332031", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82487359": {"recommendationid": "82487359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010771110", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2318, "last_played": 1608113214}, "language": "english", "review": "After enjoying X-Com so much I tried this game and I wanted to loke it so much.

Literally every game has user agreements and privacy policies among other contracts to make sure they (the company) are same.\n\nI would recommend this game to people who enjoy the tactical aspects of Xcom, because in that manner they are 80% the same. However, when you get into the classes, bases, ships, etc the game quickly strays from anything Xcom like.\n\nThe only major con of this game imo is that base buildings and armor/weapon \"upgrades\" do not feel impactful, but it hasn't bothered me much. Every weapon feels like a variation for a different playstyle than a straight upgrade and in its own way I like that. I think people get stuck in this game being \"xcom\" and it isn't suppose to be. In Xcom when you get the next assault rifle it is a very clear cut upgrade and you will most likely never go back to any other assault rifle. They become inert and useless. No gun in PP becomes truely useless imo, I personally like that. There are multiple assault rifles, once may be overall balanced, one is better in close-mid range and does more damage, one is capable of long-range, but does less damage, one may have a higher number of bullets but less damage per bullet, one may do status effect damage.

I won't comment on the whole Epic exclusive of Phoenix point. Instead, this review is on the Year One Edition.\n\nPhoenix Point is not Firaxis's XCOM. They may have genre similarities, but there are too many differences. To begin with, most of your gear is sidegrades rather then upgrades, and your soldiers can and will friendly fire each other if you do not make sure their fire lanes (or overwatch sections) are clear. Ammo is precious with you having to manufacture clips and grenades from resources that you do not passively generate either. There are many more differences, but that is enough to begin to see that this has a much different feel compared to the modern XCOM games.\n\nI have been enjoying my playthrough of Phoenix Point, and from what I've read, the base steam version is much improved (better balance, new tutorial, new non dlc gear) compared to a year ago.

I tried to find every node, etc so it took a long time:  You can waste a lot of resources bringing 19 bases back online.\n\nQuite simply this game isn't a good game. It isn't enjoyable, fun, interesting, well-developed, clever, innovative, ... anything. \n\nWhat it is is the converse of all of the above. At times I thought they'd just run off with the money and bought a bad alpha version of Firaxis' XCOM. It looks and plays like that but it isn't slick. It's still buggy and amateur. To develop a base, for example, you click a box, it fills up and then you get food. A spreadsheet would have more character. Talking of characters, the writing appears to have been done by a computer. A computer with no character.  It's dull, trite, bland and like a lot of things seems like an afterthought. It seems like they were too busy doing nothing (thank you, Prince) to realise that there might be something they could do with that which would make it better than ... I don't know. \n\nLike many I've played TFTD, Apocalypse etc. They were very basic games by today's standards yet they weren't repetitive grindfests. JA2 which I only discovered a few years ago when it was ancient history shows how you can make a brilliant game for nothing using crap (by today's standards) technology. The 'nothing' of course also being relative.\n\nThe game seems to take all the cheesy, trite memes from bad games and throw them into one. Enemies that can one-shot you from (somewhere, you don't know where because they're invisible) , enemies that can somehow disable you in one go with a grenade whereas your grenades spend all their time missing the target. Resources that are so scarce that when someone destroys a weapon of yours, you re-load.  Enemy spam.  An incredibly tedious and stupidly-designed end-boss. There's nothing innovative here at all. \n\nMuch of it seems designed to annoy you: it's not like you ever really feel that you've done something good as such and it's colourless, lifeless, re-re-re-repetitive.  \n\nI played on 'normal' aka 'veteran'. I tried to avoid conflict to slow down progression. Nope. And they don't progress so much as beef up. I tried to use stealth but of course they know where you are and can always find the exact right spot in order to hit you easily, but make it hard for you to hit them.  I tried to avoid politics but the factions will go to war and will just destroy your plans. This is a stupid mechanic as by the end even though I was clearing nest and lair and citadel after each as soon as they appeared (72 troops or so, 11 planes) another would pop up immediately afterwards. And you can't cover enough of the available area to stop them so as they wear you down that on its own is enough to mean you have to waste hours in the final mission. This was where I had to cross a large, open expanse and there was an invisible sniper on the other side. That took an hour to circumnavigate with new enemies (7 Sirens among them)  merrily popping up and ignoring the game rules of just appearing, but appearing and then shooting at your troops.  There are lots of things where the game does as it wants.\n\nAnd then there's crap design. You can have 8 troops for a mission, 9 for the last (but no one told me! And why 9, why not 10?) and that means you either take the buggy (Tiamat) that's so slow the world will have ended before its half-way there or you take 2 ships. Because that's such a clever thing to do ...\n\nI had hoped that the modders might be let loose on it and they could fix it. And it needs a lot of fixing, but it sounds like they won't really be allowed to get into it.\n\nIf you've got money to burn and you're bored, I suggest you buy a nice metal dustbin, some wood and firelighters and burn it.

It requires you to think about a tactical situation very differently from XCOM EU and XCOM 2, where each individual must be placed carefully so they don't get caught in the cross-fire as opposed to bullets magically passing through. Its also important to consider cover and line of sight with the free aim which impacts the success of your shot. There is also the added benefit that even if you miss you still can score some damage on your opponent. I also like the fact that the soldiers have accented English in accordance to nationality, something XCOM has not really done except for very specific characters. Plus the story has a cool premise that is not boxed in by the precedent set by XCOM UFO Defense.\n\nThe Bad: Unfortunately, it seems this game has put all its bets on the free-aim system and it has definitely not paid off. The strategic layer has nothing more to offer than XCOM 2. Base building is boring, and resource management even more so since your involvement with either component is pretty surface-level. The various factions aren't that interesting because acting on behalf of one makes the others unhappy. Not that this makes a difference in the overall game as the negative impact is negligible. The game looks and feels like a bad XCOM 2 mod. The character models and customization is bad. The collision physics are bad since the environments feel like its all made of cardboard when it is destroyed. The controller support feels like something the developer slapped on last minute. The mouse pointer is always in the middle of the screen even during dialog and cutscenes. The cutscenes seem to be entirely comprised of concept art and textboxes. I have not finished a full campaign as of this review because the thought of going back to this game makes me consider what I would rather be doing. The game has committed the worst sin imaginable; it's boring and the developer wants you to pay $60 for a game that's realistically worth $20-15. It's highway robbery.\n\nThe Ugly: The mutants are, of course, pretty ugly. So is the EULA, which admittedly I did not read very carefully.\n\nConclusion: The free-aim system is a cool and interesting spin on the classic XCOM dice roll as was advertised. I was waiting for this game to be available on Steam for a year and was happy about it being on 50% sale.  However, it seems that the year was not spent wisely on this game. Its pretty buggy, the gameplay is boring, its badly optimized, and its a far more expensive as a game than what is called for. Plus, its like all of the things I did not like about XCOM EU ended up here.

This means that after a bad setback (i.e. less than one well-equipped squad in the lategame, when generally you'll only have 1.5-2 going), it's extremely hard to work your way back. There are also very few weapons/technologies/abilities that give you a decisive advantage over the aliens, so there's no ability to get that plasma rifle or whatever and swing back the odds. Those buildings/weapons that do make a difference also take piles of resources and ages to build/research, which discourages experimenting with novel strategies.\n- The game is extraordinarily mechanically tedious at times with lots of clicks per engagement - i.e. if you're feeling a bit grumpy about having lost your A-Team, expect a large amount of real-world time before you get a win that makes you feel better. This also goes for outfitting your soldiers, who will ideally be tailored for each encounter. Longish load times and frequent bugs and personal missteps (did you not see the small icon that indicated your target would return fire?) only increase this problem.\n- The world doesn't feel worth saving. The factions are catty and ludonarratively interchangeable (e.g. Synedrion's internal bickering the whole time doesn't seem to affect much mechanically). The world is a succession of bombed out wastelands ad nauseam, sprinkled with occasional Apple stores (Synedrion), prison factories (New Jericho), slums (Anu) and impossible to navigate alien slaughterhouses, all essentially devoid of civilians.

Skipping missions this time might be an option, since you gotta go forward on defending the faction you love ( or try defend all of them, good luck! ) or advancing the story. Get ready to let Havens get destroyed left and right, slowing down the Pandorans assaults, as you find their Nests and researching new Tech.\n\nUnique Factions:\nRight now, 8 factions are available, and thats AMAZING!! \nPhoenix Point, New Jericho, Synedrion, Disciples of Anu, The Pure, The Forsaken, Indipendents and Pandorans.\nYou are the Neutral Phoenix Point, can Ally with any of the first 3 factions, or actually go at war with them!\nYeah! the whole world can be on fire with firefights left and right while the Virus goes on infecting anyone. You can actually steal enemy (or allies) resources, or recruit their soldiers (with their exclusive gear) to fight with you, or even steal their aircrafts! Because yes, you are NOT stucked with just one lil Aircraft, you can have many with many squads (compared to the ridicolous logic of XCOM where you can only have 1 and can be only in one place) and visit multiple places at once!\nOh and you need heavy vehicles? YES there are VEHICLES! Different per factions.\nYou want the classic Army Men faction? Ally with NJ. Wanna use Lasers and Stealth and Status Alterations? Join Synedrion. Wanna be an ugly mutant but can use mutations and mind control? Be a follower of Anu. Wanna discover NJ secret Exo Suits? Follow The Pure Leader Transmissions and steal some research for it! Wanna have actual Bandits on your team with their shitty equipment? Save them in some Rescue Missions!\n\nDeeper Tactical Warfare:\nFrom spending your AP to however you want, to actually manually aim like a FPS to weakspots when attacking the enemy. Every body part disabled has its purpose, Human or Monster. No more \"Chance of hit\", you gotta aim, and if you have a good soldier with the proper weapon, you'll land at least one shot, with the new Realistic Ballistic. \n\nCosplay!:\nYep, customization is kinda restricted because now armor has a purpose, and its not just to look pretty (sorry but NJ Factions Armory is a damn good looking one). and you can use all the armor outfits from every factions! Including rough and rusty Bandits outfits and weapons! Oh and every soldier has its inventory where you gotta make sure you have ammo and items always ready!\n\nResearch =/= Difficulty:\nBack in XCOM, the longer you take the more advanced the enemy is. Well here is different. The Pandorans\nyes they get stronger, but you DO NOT have to research new weapons! Yes advanced weapons are there, but they just kill the enemy faster, not smarter. You can have a well trained squad with basic armor and weapons and still win a late game mission. Infact, the only real advanced weapons are NJ Armor Piercing Tech, or PP Cannon, but you can and you WILL stick to one Armor Set ( depend which faction you like, their stats are almost the same) and your weapons of choice, you're not forced to upgrade your weapons because some aliens has x60 armor or x100 HP ( cough\" XCOM mutons or sectopods).\nAnd if you Ally with the Factions, you'll have access to their tech, or you can just steal a random one in a raid.\nOh and if you have enough loot, you can reverse engineer weapons and armor sets so you can research it and created those items on your own\n\nA Secondary Objective:\nIf you're tired of shooting crabs, go at war with the factions! if you see The Disciples attacking NJ, go ahead and defend them! Synedrion is attacking a Nest? Join them! The Pure machines are attacking a Temple of Anu? Join the fight! Synedrion and The Pure attacking each other? Wait it out until they are both weak and destroy them all! All the forces involved are actually on the battlefield. with their respective turns and tactics!\n\nClasses:\nPP and NJ have both Assault, Heavy and Snipers, but all of them have unique Classes, NJ has a Technician, can be a combat medic or mechanic, can deploy turrets be a support. Synedrion has an Infiltrator, can move around in Stealth mode and uses Crossbows. Disciples have Bersekers, melee tough guys. Once you acquire their research, you can train your soldiers with a second class at lv.4, and add to their basic training, one extra class. If things goes to worse, don't worry, everyone can use everyone's weapons, they might just suck at using them.\n\nThis game is AWESOME, definitely an 8/10 LOVE IT", "timestamp_created": 1608017222, "timestamp_updated": 1608017222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535432815551757813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82407892": {"recommendationid": "82407892", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998580717", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2252, "last_played": 1608872710}, "language": "english", "review": "Really? it's a worse xcom. i have found a few bugs and some good old hard crashes, once at the end of a mission the game crashed as appose to ending and i couldn't do anything but kill the game and restart.

But after finishing the game, I can't recommend it. It's long, grindy, choices don't matter, soldiers are impersonal, and it lacks a sense of epicness.\nThe lore is really good. But that's about it.\nTo me, Phoenix Point took the fun out of X-Com.\n\nAfter 20h of playing the game I was bored: a lot of missions with little impact on the story, allegiance mechanics that lead to no real benefits (it s basically some lore), and the combats seemed repetitive.\n\nAfter 40h of playing I had found a way, mixing classes, to deal unlimited damages in close combat and I was desperate to end as fast as possible all those useless battles. There are no meaningful upgrades on the weapons and no upgrades at all on the armors. My teams kept the basic armor they had at the beginning through the whole game (while monsters get huge upgrades in heath and/or armor), and for the weapons just get some shotguns and the 2 unique weapons that have no need of ammo through the DLC's missions. It's enough to kill the boss.\n\nThere are limitations like you cannot move people from a base to another one without using a airplane. Why not. The idea is that you have to manage your soldiers to defend your bases appropriately. But. Your gear for exemple has no such restriction. So before a mission, I removed the gear from the last team that went on mission to put the gear on the next team that was about to go hot... even if they were 2 continents apart.\nWhy would I be doing that? Because the game depends only on your Research, I would prefer to invest everything in it then to buy a pair of pant for my heavy (which is about the same price as building a Research Center, go figure).\n\nTook me 68h to finish the game. The last 20h were spent waiting to finish Researches that would unlock the end of the game (with no impact on the gameplay whatesoever). I am a completionist (so I thought) but I got so bored with the game I didn't want to explore anymore, didnt want to look for the shiny weapons of the DLC which upgrade is basically to have no need of ammo. I just wanted out of this game. Finish it as quickly as possible.\n\nSo if you are looking for a X-Com 2 type of experience, sorry but as of now, Phoenix Point is not it.\nThis game is for people who enjoy tactical games, and are not bored by doing impactless missions, over and over again.\nFor some satisfying management or sense of accomplishment, just go back to X-Com 2 :)", "timestamp_created": 1607960433, "timestamp_updated": 1608216720, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 227, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.890525102615356445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82348995": {"recommendationid": "82348995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005667708", "num_games_owned": 494, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 12300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6246, "last_played": 1609075518}, "language": "english", "review": "Release was bumpy, and some people will never forgive the jump to epic.\n\nBut aside all that, looking at the game as it is now, it's really good.

The game seems to be steering me towards turning against a faction and stealing their research, but players shouldn't be forced to do that. I've never run out of things to research in any other XCOM franchise game\n\n- There doesn't seem to be a clear path on how to proceed and the population keeps dropping. No new Pandoran nests appear, and even when I take one, the mist does not recede\n\n+ Exploration seems to be the way to extending your aircraft's range; it's a different approach and can't say I'm opposed to the idea at the moment\n\n====\n\n25 hours in:\n\n+ combat is where PP shines. Environments seem destructible, and free aiming works well with LOS and obstruction\n\n-  Ok so you don't have to recruit engineers or scientists -- presumably they come with the base facilities you build -- but they don't need to eat.. only your soldiers consume food. Do the labs and factories come with kitchens and food supplies or something?\n\n====\n\nTLDR: Phoenix Point is a good game, not a great one, but that\u2019s not its fault. Although the genre is mature and overcrowded, there\u2019s enough here for TBS fans to enjoy and appreciate.\n\nLet me begin by saying that I have not played XCOM2, and cannot make comparisons between the two games. I have however played all the other original XCOM games, XCOM:EU and rebooted franchises like UFO and Xenonauts.This type of game -- alien-invasion type turn-based strategy with tactical combat -- is a very familiar one to gamers, as the genre has been around for a long time. As such, it is very difficult to break new ground, improve on classic systems that work, or refine time-tested designs and approaches. Nine hours in, these are my impressions so far (I will update this review after I complete the game if those change):\n\n+ Storyline is decent, graphics are fresh and updated, voice-acting for the campaign is good, music is appropriate without being too repetitive of annoying\n\n+ Materials / resource management in bases adds another strategic layer, and resupply missions (without incurring too many troop injuries) become vital. These resources have replaced the monetary units that you used to need to buy things, recruit soldiers, etc\n\n+ Combat works well: bullet ballistics, LOS all appear sensible, and \"free aiming\" allows you to make targeted shots against creatures' weak spots for better tactical outcomes\n\n+ Diplomacy has been updated and enhanced; you can gain advantages by allying with a particular faction, while raiding the others for equipment, research or supplies\n\n+ I found the user interface streamlined, without unnecessary switching from one screen to another. The changes are subtle but improved from other similar-genre games\n\n+ The ability to trade with factions (and recruit from them) is a nice touch, especially since some resources (like tech) can be hard to find. This enhances the strategic choices in building, recruiting and manufacturing -- everything uses these resources, so which do you pick first?\n\n- Fuel doesn\u2019t seem to matter for your aircraft. I\u2019m assuming they get refuelled at the havens you land in, but this doesn\u2019t seem clear. Range management used to be an issue in the early XCOM-type games, so you had to pick your bases carefully. This isn\u2019t the case anymore (even though you still have to pick your bases carefully, for other reasons)\n\n- As a way of standing out more, RPG elements could have been improved. Some gamers may disagree, but having troops with personalities can add to the satisfaction of bringing them into the battle throughout the campaign. Instead, they're just throwaway units here, which IMO is a missed opportunity\n\n- After so many years of games in this genre (and so many lessons to learn from), there still isn\u2019t enough here to make it great, or truly memorable. The formula is more or less the same, with some useful refinements and new features, but nothing earth-shattering enough to make you sit up and take notice\n\nFinal thoughts (for now): The field is overcrowded, so the competition is stiff; it\u2019s difficult to stand out here. Is Phoenix Point a must-have game? Maybe, but it doesn\u2019t belong at the top of that list. Does it break new ground or take the crown in the genre? Not in my opinion, but it has enough features and refinements that still make it worth getting/playing, and make it worth recommending. \n\n6.5/10.0", "timestamp_created": 1607893696, "timestamp_updated": 1608946206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.787171840667724609", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82298415": {"recommendationid": "82298415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049825807", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1614739230}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game.

Restarted once, and I feel like I barely scratch the surface.\n\nWhile the game itself is a mixed feeling and I understand why some people leave a negative review, my experience is more positive than the negative one. Here is my thought in no particular order.\n\nFirst of all, this is like a modern XCOM but without the XCOM hassles on the tactical layer. The realistic bullet really lives up to its name. No more 95% chance at point-blank and still miss. That itself already made that this is not an XCOM game. If my shot is missed, it was not because the RNG is rigged, but I accept the fact that the aiming angle was difficult or it was too far that the bullet spreads. However, if it actually hits the target, it feels satisfying.\n\nThe game has a \"doomsday clock\" that keeps ticking the longer you spend time in the Geoscape. And I could not seems to reverse or halt it. This itself is not bad, but it gives me a little bit of anxiety. I have no knowledge about the game, I don't know the meta, I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. What if I already messed up at the beginning? Just thinking about it makes me feel tired. I wish if there is a \"practice mode\" or mod to disable the clock, I would be grateful for learning purpose before actually jump into the real game.\n\nThe game is a little bit repetitive compared to XCOM at the beginning, You started with 5 squads (or 6 if you already recruited one more soldier) and that will be your whole team for the first game (or maybe it will be your team for the entire game, I don't know). Compared to XCOM that you have to send different squads into a different mission.\n\nThe game has more management than the modern XCOM. You actually need to bring a magazine to use a reload. And you need to manufacture one or you will run out of them in the field and become useless. New recruit usually does not have anything. Yes, they are 'naked', no armor, no guns. You have to build the equipment for them manually which may take time. Except if you recruit it directly from the faction's haven.

Good way to present the story in budget\n\nWhat I don't like:\n- Lack of level variations. Most places feel similar\n- Lack of enemy variations. The variations are only presence in what weapon they bring, or armor in some part.\n- Lack of excitement.

The realistic bullet trajectory system, while not actually *strictly* realistic, feels a lot more versimilitudinous than Xcom's percent chance to hit system. It also does away with the finicky and sometimes tactically counterintuitive 'pod' system Xcom featured, both changes that IMO improve the tactical layer.  \n\nIt has cyborg soldiers and mutations (with the blood and steel expansion) like Enemy Within did, which is cool.

Doubtless I am not the first and will not be the last to compare and contrast the two, but it is an important point to make, nonetheless.\n\nWhile the XCOM games of the modern day give you plenty of soldiers early on, you must train them and keep them alive as best you can, because talent is scarce. Phoenix Point takes an almost inverted approach, in that you start with a scant team that you can't really afford to lose in the early game, but as you progress and build training facilities, it becomes easier to replace those super-soldiers who have fallen in the line of duty. I prefer the Phoenix approach, because the former feels like building an ever taller house of cards that could crumble and leave you with nothing at the first major mistake, while the latter feels like building an aeroplane as you fly it; terrifying at first but gradually more and more stable.\n\nXCOM leaves whether or not shots connect with their target up to the big random number generator in the sky, while Phoenix lets you take matters into your own hands with manual aiming and a much, MUCH more robust movement system. The predictions that Phoenix provides, however, are not always as accurate as one would hope, leading to the awkward situation where you move your aiming reticle over an enemy's silhouette, and believe for all the world that your shot will end their life, only for the camera to pull back and reveal your bullet colliding with the tip of the stalagmite your soldier was using as half-cover, totally blocking the attack. Still, when it works, it's good.\n\nCharacter classes are far better in Phoenix, with a system that allows the mixing and matching of the seven classes to create horrifying amalgams that combine each class's five abilities in new and exciting ways. Still, a little annoying trait is that each soldier must spend ability points on their new abilities, often forcing you to choose which skills are worth using and which you'd never actually employ. You can get as many ability points per soldier as successful missions you have them survive, but this leads to a re-treading of the XCOM issue where the strongest soldiers are the ones you've had all game long, and losing one will nullify a lot of your forward momentum.\n\nMy last comparison is regarding equipment. Grenades, the battle defining weapon of the XCOM games, are more or less useless in Phoenix, but replacing the XCOM Arc Thrower is Phoenix's Neurazer, not merely a tool for capturing enemies but a truly invaluable weapon in it's own right. There's no \"basic kit\" that you have an infinite supply of; each weapon and piece of armour is made to order, meaning four crafting projects are required to fully outfit a bare-naked soldier. Recruited soliders must be given guns on Hero difficulty and guns AND armour on Legend difficulty, or else the fresh meat becomes dead meat very quickly. This is offset by the fact that you can steal weapons (but not armour) from dead enemies in battle sometimes (it's random whether they drop them or not). So, swings and roundabouts.\n\nGoing off of these comparisons alone, I believe Phoenix Point to not merely be a XCOM clone, but rather the superior game, with a lot more strategic depth and room for decision making. It's definitely rough around the edges, but I feel that adds to it's charm.

I had the pleasure to review it a year ago, so please take in consideration that my Steam play time does not reflect my experience with [b]Phoenix Point[/b]. In fact, my playtime of 120 hours on Epic, could barely justify this review, since the included content is just subliminally impressive and will give you at least 300 hours of solid gameplay.\n\nFrom the man himself, Mr. Julian Gollop, the mind behind X-COM, comes [b]Phoenix Point[/b], a video game that borrows the elements that made his work so famous for, into a new generation of gamers, and classic fans such as myself. To better understand the importance of [b]Phoenix Point[/b], try to imagine Star Wars classics, but made in today\u2019s age, while still being the most epic movies you could imagine.\n\nSome say classics are classics due to their nostalgia and although they serve as inspiration, they cannot be replicated. However, in this particular case, the well known British producer and designer actually managed to create an instant classic, with all the gameplay, visuals and style we could only hope for.\n\nWhen the time came to create a universe and a solid story-line, Snapshot Games did what I always considered to be the best approach. Pick something real, and expand it using your own imagination, and thus here we are, with the Pandoravirus: originally discovered by scientists in Antarctica back in 2013, it serves as the main event behind [b]Phoenix Point[/b].\n\nAfter the entire planet fell into obscurity by death, violence and monstrosity creatures, a special unit entitled [b]Phoenix Point[/b] was created, to fight and contain such mutations. Now, with the full universe waiting for you, the goal is simple: Find, restore and equip fallen bases.\n\nAs you expected, [b]Phoenix Point[/b] is a turn-based strategy game, where you\u2019ll control a unit composed of a certain number of soldiers. You take turns in exploring, attacking and if needed, cover other soldiers on the field. The gameplay is impeccable, allowing players to customize their soldiers from the ground up. Train their abilities, set their skills and put them to the test on the battlefield.\n\nSoldiers grow in skill and can become experts in specific weapon types, to further boost the inflicted damage. While in turns, you take control of each soldier, and you can even select what part of your enemy you want to shoot at. It reminds me of V.A.T.S, from the Fallout series. It works as intended, allowing for perfect head-shots or nailing that weak spot.\n\nWhile traversing the universe, you\u2019ll come across three distinct factions that live by their own set of rules. The Disciples of Anu which are a strict religious group, New Jericho are the ones who firmly believe in purity of the human body, and in the end we have Synedrion, which are those who embraced technology and aim to become one with it.\n\nhe game allows you to choose who you want to support, and while exploring the universe, several side-quests will pop-up. It\u2019s impossible to be diplomatic with everyone, and sometimes one choice will benefit one group, above others. It\u2019s also possible to try and scam these factions, as well as commit acts of thievery towards them.\n\nWhen it comes to performance, [b]Phoenix Point[/b] is very well optimized, even for a game running on Unity.

Only because.  You can mod this, just not via Steam.  So I modded the hell out of it and started to enjoy it.  Then a super massive enemy turned up - and I'm going to have to mod it even further...  But I've now pushed the Price per Hour past the point where I feel I got value for money out of the game.  So that is my metric and I have to give it a thumbs up.\n\nWhen modding this - Because I need the balance to not change other than the Phoenix guys to have a chance - I end up changing just the Phoenix standard kit.  That means that there is no longer any weapon progression... But then that was kinda limited anyway.\n\nBut really - the sniper rifle has to become an anti-material rifle AS50 type thing.  The assault rifle needs to become a MK48 squad automatic.  And the Heavy cannon has to become a TOW launcher / anti tank recoilless rifle.... Or let's face it:  It has to become an M230 chain gun.  This is all very do-able.  And once you do this you can play like a noob, just like me.\n\n[Original post below]\n\n\nRight - I've hit a brick wall...  I got this game on sale - so have gotten \u00a31 per hour out of it.  That isn't bad.  But.....\n\nOK - the game is great - then it's not.  This is the familiar progression of the early XCOM games and their imitators.  So in the early game this is massive fun, the units feel nice and the balance is good.  The early game is epic.  The weapons are all relevant and you have options.  There is loads to do - there is over-world diplomacy, resource management, factions and bases to build.  There is exploration!  There is expansion.  And with the cool DLCs there are things and side plots to follow.  It's epic! \n\nBut then things change.\n\nI understand that the world is in a hopeless state and that everyone's going to die, etc., etc.  But this just sucks when you hit a certain point....  It's basically game over if you haven't hit certain gear checks at that point.  And it's cookie cutter - if you don't have these units before it happens you lose - if you do - this is all you do and there are no options and nothing else.. It's over if you liked doing \"stuff\".\n\nAt about the time when the missile launcher enemies appear and the Sirens appear the whole thing becomes \"meta\".  You either have this meta or you lose.  In the beginning the Heavy infantry has been useless, absolute garbage.  The Assaults had been OK and the Snipers had been the most important units.  There are other cool units too - but at about the time you start to get them - the game goes meta.\n\nThe problem comes from armour.  A certain armour level cancels all damage.\n\nAll of a sudden... The Sirens appear and they can Mind Control.  OK.  That makes a certain head armour mandatory, and it's a good head armour.  But choice is removed.  You simply have to have this bionic head armour.  If you don't - you lose a team mate, or two, or three every turn..  Ok....\n\nAll of a sudden the enemies have such high armour that assault rifles can't touch them.  Or if they can; the enemies have so much hit points that the small amount of damage you do isn't enough.  You need six assault rifle troops, focused, to take a single enemy to 50% health.   There are two main assault rifles, powerful inaccurate short range devices, which are the only ones which can do any damage at all.  And long range accurate ones which, unfortunately, don't do any damage at all anymore after the sirens appear.  The enemies tend to have the long rage ones - but you don't have armour or hit pools like they do - so the long range accurate ones still kill you after two bursts...  Enemies get two bursts a turn... So assaults do a bit of damage - and are then immediately killed the following turn.  Because it's grim in the future.\n\nHeavy infantry get a special weapon via a DLC.  And it means that unless you have this at the point where SIrens appear you need to restart.  This means that at that point in the game you need these units, more or less, exclusively as no other weapon in the game is relevant anymore, and basically no other troop in the game is relevant either.  They might nerf this weapon, but if they do then the game is basically fail.\n\nSnipers are rendered useless too - because they no longer have enough damage potential to stop the enemies from killing them before they are killed by the enemies.  It's grim and hopeless in the future.  [As per the XCOM games - in the later game a new recruit is useless - so useless that they can't really gain any XP and will die before they have done so - so it's unacceptable to suffer a loss later on - injuries are OK - but later on they will just be killed outright and you won't get injured troops, just dead ones... so unless you follow the meta and don't deviate from that - you will just lose soldiers and then have recruits and die.]\n\nIf you get heavies with the ancient grenade launcher - then you just win.  If you don't have that yet - you die.  You have to have the first bionic head, or else you become an alien.  If you have both you win.  If you don't you failed.\n\nthat is shite.\n\nThe game becomes worse the longer you play it.  It needs MOD support.  It will never get MOD support because of the way it has been released.  It's such a shame.\n\n[EDIT]\n\nSo I continued.  I so desperately want to love this game.  And I don't have anything else to play at the moment.  So I'm scum saving like mad.\n\nI've now noticed that the best way to kill my team is to open fire on the enemy :(.  Every time you fire at them they get to return fire.  You get this ability too - but the enemy usually disables one of your arms when they shoot you so you don't get to return fire.  I managed to basically kill one of my squads by firing on an enemy who then simply returned fire, every shot, doing virus and bleed damage.  I ran out of medikits.\n\nI did a mission in a massive alien hive - and the structure you are supposed to kill has so many hit points an 8 man team ran out of ammunition before it was brought down.....\n\nThe enemy just always disable arms.  And then you have a useless soldier....  I have the best armour in the game, I think, the robotic tier 1 body... Enemy melees and... no arm left.  I get shot - no arms left.  I open fire, they return fire... No arms left.\n\nCover doesn't do anything.  At least not at this stage in the game.  No arms left.\n\nAnd you just don't have enough firepower.  \n\nSnake lady siren gets within melee range.  You just don't have enough firepower.  She will kill players and also other players will not have any arms left... before you kill her..  Apparently you have to \"Capture\" one of these....  The stun thing does 7!!!  LOL.  This could be a fun challenge - you only need 3 or 4 hits with the stun thing - so you need 4 dudes dedicated to this task out of your 8, but usually only 6....  However you are so desperately needing to scum save and re-roll any failed sniper shot - you don't really have any spare capacity to try and have \"fun\".\n\nOhh and now I'm running out of resources too.  Yay.\n\nIf only recruits were not useless, (you really HAVE to reload if a player gets killed :( ).  If only your weaponry wasn't useless, (you need to scum save - as even if you miss they will take your arm off with a pistol from across the map).  If only you could make enough stuff to keep up with the attrition rate, (you need to think about throwing a hand grenade because you might not have the resources of the capacity to restock...).\n\nI've now reached the point where even the big assault rifles don't have enough firepower to hurt some of the enemies.  They can still hurt the trash mobs, (whilst they still have arms to fire at them).  But the grenade launcher and siren enemies are immune to damage from anything other than the laser sniper rifles now.\n\nThis just isn't fun...

Such a disappointment... I'm so close to finishing the game, but my A-Team has been ambushed and I've just run out of patience with the game. It has so many good things going for it, but that just makes the flaws even worse. Let's go from the top.\n\nGOOD THINGS:\n\nDepth: Phoenix Point has lots of different weapons, abilities, and research paths. There are a lot of different ways to approach a situation. Maybe you can use New Jericho rockets with a GL and go maximum explosions, or you can go sneaky with a Synedrion Infiltrator, or you can use the giant mutant doggos from the Cult of Anu.\n\nFree Aiming: Basically Phoenix Point's main selling... Well... 'Point' if you'll excuse the pun. Whenever you shoot at an enemy, you can direct your soldier's fire towards certain parts. There's nothing better than blowing the gun out of an enemy's hands, leaving them dumbfounded. More than once I've neutered an Arthron Tyrant by blowing off their MG arm, leaving them to run into my guns to try and poison me at close range.\n\nBig Nasties: You can fight some big nasty monsters that genuinely take a lot of effort and teamwork to put down, unlike the bigger enemies in other XCOM-style games. You're best off taking out the smaller ones before focusing your attention on the big monster.\n\nBAD THINGS:\n\nConfused Game: Phoenix Point can't decide whether it wants to be like X-COM or XCOM. You get individual customisable soldiers with a load of cool abilities, incentivising you to protect them and level them up, like the new XCOM games. On the other hand, armour is quite frankly not worth a damn, and they die way too easily but are just as easy to replace, like the old X-COMs. Which one do you want to be Phoenix Point? You can't be both.\n\nJank: I mentioned free aiming and how it's basically the game's main selling point. Unfortunately, free aiming is jank AF. Multiple times I've had a literally guaranteed shot on a close-range enemy, only for my shots to literally phase through them harmlessly, before they then run up and kill my precious max-level soldier, because as I said armour isn't worth a damn. Also, it doesn't play nice with loading sometimes, occasionally CTDing, and then there's the infamous endless enemy turn bug. Then there's enemies landing constant bullseye shots with pistols from across the map, sometimes shooting through solid objects that would usually block LoS.\n\nAmbushes: As I said, I've lost the will to finish the game because of an ambush. Basically, you're told to explore for resources. Oh look, here's an exploration area and WHOOPSIEDAYSIE ambush. Unskippable mandatory mission where you don't get any rewards and you're placed in the middle of a swarm of high-level  enemies. Maybe if there was a warning system, say you go to an area and before you click 'Explore', there's a \"x% chance of ambush\", which could increase with things like mist of proximity to nests etc. Unfortunately, ambushes are just random, tedious, and punish you for trying to play the game properly.\n\nThe Great Betrayal: They sold out their backers for the Epic exclusivity deal. I'd keep a wary eye on these developers in the future if I were you.\n\nIf you're looking for a cool XCOM experience, either boot up Enemy Unknown of OpenXCOM. I guarantee you you'll have a much better time. Maybe I'll come back to Phoenix Point in a year or so, assuming it ever gets workshop support so people can remove the bad stuff, such as ambushes and janky free aiming.", "timestamp_created": 1607702636, "timestamp_updated": 1607702636, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525547444820404053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82082411": {"recommendationid": "82082411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004701225", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 2864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95, "last_played": 1608447566}, "language": "english", "review": "Really disappointed that this game is supposedly made by the creator of Xcom yet all my soldiers survived the tutorial and nobody missed a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1607699664, "timestamp_updated": 1607699664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82075290": {"recommendationid": "82075290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019269989", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 2925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2654, "last_played": 1607739051}, "language": "english", "review": "It's alright", "timestamp_created": 1607694078, "timestamp_updated": 1607694078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82069314": {"recommendationid": "82069314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001670125", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "playtime_at_review": 797, "last_played": 1619207978}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm enjoying this a lot.

I've updated where relevant.\n\nInitial missions start off quite well, and I have to say that I have enjoyed the updated tutorial missions and early game, both of which provide an enjoyable degree of tension, but before too long both your own soldiers and the enemies that you'll face become terribly overpowered - This has quite rightly been nerfed to a degree, however it still leads to a situation where the game ends up being more about trying to alpha strike the enemy with your superhuman squad before they can do the same to you. Top tier soldiers, moving at top speed, are able to cover a large percentage of the map in a single turn and whilst doing so still have the possibility to shoot multiple enemies and regain actions along the way, thus making the whole 'turn based' aspect of turn based strategy redundant. None of this is helped by the fact that the maps themselves are tiny, meaning that you and your opponent will nearly always be right on top of each other from the start of every mission and rarely experience any change of pace.\n\nThe perks themselves are pretty bland, usually some variation of doing more damage, increasing accuracy, or increasing movement/will. I think a lot of these enhancements could have been better served if they had been applied via scientific research and development of new equipment. I can enjoy seeing a new gun or projectile doing additional damage, but a unit suddenly being able to do more damage because they've randomly trained to do so doesn't make sense to me, and a unit suddenly being able to will themselves to move faster also feels quite bizarre (This, in particular, is basically magic and, for me, it doesn't fit with the setting). \n\nThe game relies on its USP of a free-aiming system - This was an interesting idea in theory, but I found that trying to estimate what area of a targeting reticule was filled became stale fast and would have preferred at least the option to be able to switch to seeing the percentage chance to hit whatever I was aiming at instead. I think Snapshot themselves possibly recognise that this system is flawed as they've gone through a number of different visual representations of trying to show the player how much damage an expected shot might do. I wish they would just give an option to show the numbers that are being used to create that visual representation instead of finding new ways to obfuscate those numbers.\n- There's also the issue that animations continue to cycle after firing your first shot, so you may think that you have 100% covered an opponent with the targeting reticule and are therefore guaranteed to hit, however that opponent may well have moved out of the way by the time your projectiles reach it. \n- Basic features such as change of stance and different firing modes for weapons aren\u2019t present, and movement is grid-based, neither of which mesh well with a free-aim system. Instead, you have to rely on finding full or low cover (basically half cover, but at least here your unit will finally crouch) and hoping that your squad member will use that cover in an effective way. Compare this with games such as Valkyria Chronicles or Age of Fear, both of which have forms of free-aim but also allow the player to precisely control the positioning of their units.\n- The free aim system also creates problems of its own when combined with a damage system which allows you to target different body areas - headshots, for example, aren't fatal (as they would be too easy to make), but you will be able to experience death by being shot in the toe when your unit decides to not use cover in the way that you hope they might.\n\nThe strategic layer is okay and serves its purpose, but it is quite basic, the same goes for base building (I think that Snapshot have missed a trick by giving you an almost fully functioning base at the start of the game as this leaves less to discover) \n\nThe story is similar, it serves its purpose in driving the game forward and doesn't really do much wrong beyond being a bit cliched and tropey (the factions especially), but I'm not playing an X-Com type TBS game for its story in the first place. I do like that the factions will actively go to war with each other, I'd like to see the diplomacy system be developed more. \n\nAmbient sound is good, it adds atmosphere and I think helps to create the right mood for the game. More voice acting would be nice, but I appreciate that PP was produced on a budget. Lack of background music doesn't bother me especially, though it does feel a little strange for Snapshot to make this decision after the music score of Chaos Reborn was received so well. (Chaos Reborn, Snapshot's first title is a game that I would strongly recommend btw). \n\nGraphics are strange - I quite like the washed-out pallet, this also enhances the mood, but I'm finding it very difficult to make out details in any units (this is on top-end graphical settings). Without clicking on them, I'm often unable to distinguish the different load outs of opponents and have had to use colour to be able to make my own squad members stand out from each other. (I don't mean just for the same unit type either, I can't easily tell the difference between a sniper and my assaults in their starting gear) I'm also finding that the camera angle is hindering gameplay, I appreciate being able to zoom in and out of the map, and now being able to also freely rotate, but I really want to also be able to tilt and freely pan that camera so that I can check different firing angles and positions before I move units. - I think again Snapshot recognise that there is an issue with the camera as they have provided sight-lines in order to hold the player's hand and let them know which tiles allow a shot on enemies before moving units to those tiles... but those sight-lines wouldn't be necessary if the player was able to effectively gauge whether the shot was on by just looking at the map in the first place.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game as a whole could be fantastic, and the original idea of a Lovecraftian horror TBS horror game was fantastic, but I feel that it is spoilt by the overpowered skills and aids given to the player such as sight-lines and being able to 'hear' units that you can't see meaning that you've effectively got x-ray vision. It's more Marvel's idea of horror than Lovecraft's. \n\nAnd that leads to a final point which is that everyone will have different preference of how they like to play any given game, and PP at the moment is missing out on the opportunity to facilitate that by providing menu options to players that would allow each player to apply those preferences. Sight-lines on/off, free camera on/off, fatal headshots on/off, change of stance on/off etc.\n\nOverall I don't think PP is a terrible game, whilst I am highlighting flaws in this review, I feel like there was/is the potential for a decent game. It has a number of interesting mechanics and a good concept, unfortunately, those mechanics are often fighting against each other and I feel that they ruin the original concept. On the flipside, the devs are still actively working on the game both in terms of creating content and improving systems. On Metacritic, in May I gave a score of 4/10 I'm now probably considering it as a 5 or a 6. I wish steam allowed a neutral review option. \n\nIf you liked the modern Firaxis XCom games, if you like superhero games, or if you like short tactical battle games then you might enjoy Phoenix Point; but if you were a fan of the original XComs/UFO titles, if you want a true horror title, or if you're looking for a slower-paced turn-based strategy game then don\u2019t expect Phoenix Point to meet your needs.

I started playing this thinking: It looks like XCOM, sounds like XCOM and feels like XCOM, so I'm going to play it like XCOM.\n\nWRONG!\n\nThis is a beast all of its own. Yes, there is tactical combat and yes there is a geoscape and yes there is research, but it differs on some key elements that make it a different experience. \nIt feels to me like a mix of XCOM and Mount & Blade. The game is less structured and guided than XCOM and that makes it inherently a more difficult game, but also one that makes for even more replayability.\nYou can mix and match classes, there are a lot of weapons to get and the aliens get quite varied with their mods.\n\nThe tactical combat is more direct than XCOM. There are more enemies and the maps require less running around to find your foes. The aiming system is really fun and makes you look at terrain in a different way than many of the game's tactical peers. I'm enjoying the monster design and the challenges that they bring to the player.\n\nOne thing that made the game stand out to me is that there is more interaction with the world than in Firaxis' XCOM. Leaders talk to you, small settlements can give you quests with a story behind them and you can decide to attack settlements or help them in various ways. This is the part where my Mount and Blade feel came into play. I'm generally roaming around the world in my little plane visiting sites with little events and fighting off Pandoren. This is contrary to XCOM, where you had to retun to base after every mission.\n\nOne thing this game lacks compared to XCOM is the visual customization of your troops. There are only a handful of options and the faces tend to be completely obscured by helmets most of the time, so the soldiers feel less like your own, despite them being much more unique due to the various traits they have in combination with the mix- and match class system. \nAnother thing is that PP is a lot less polished than XCOM. There are bugs here and there, the UI is not as intuitive and the game doesn't guide the player into itself as much. I didn't find it a deal breaker, but it does show the higher experience Firaxis has with making games compared to Snapshot.\n\nI like the music well enough, it suits the theme of the world being to shit and you fighting a desperate battle to not have the entire population get extinct. The voice acting is pretty good as well and builds even more upon the atmosphere. The three factions that are still present in the world (outside of the Pandoren) are unique and believable.\n\nI'd say if you're a fan of tactical combat and science fiction, give this game a go.

No play though is going to be the same, but the mechanics will be.  I realized about four hours after the world was lost in my first game, that Phoenix Point's difficulty is mainly due to overly complicated game mechanics that are poorly explained.\n\nIn X-Com 2, you have a traveling military base and can deploy whatever combination of soldiers you need where ever they are needed, and there's often a binary choice with advantages and tradeoffs between optional missions.  Here, you have to coordinate intercontinental bases staffed with personnel, and manage your resources in a way that is arbitrary and leaves little room for experimentation.  X-Com 2 puts a lot of agency in the player's hands regarding how they want to advance through tech trees or what goals they want to prioritize.  Phoenix Point appears to do that as well, but it's largely an illusion - the enemies are constantly outpacing your organization's development, so if you waste resources building a facility with a limited scope of utilization or don't pursue a mission that would result in the relationship development you need to unlock some certain technology, you will be so far behind that whatever struggles you take on for the next several hours of gameplay will be for naught.\n\nIn Phoenix Point, it's possible to do everything right, and still lose.

But PP is regrettably a flop.\n\nInitial excitement phase of exploration and familiarisation with game mechanics lasted about 8 hours for me. After that I became suspicious about snowballing mission difficulty and had done a bit of research. Wish I done it before purchasing, but sale price done its trick. \nWell it confirmed that this game has a terrible Adaptive Difficulty algorithm. It effectively punishes player\u2019s success by adjusting enemy level to maintain the same \u201cfeel\u201d of the game. \nI know that this technique is becoming popular lately, but it does not make it anything less than lazy way of hiding dev incompetence. And here this is implemented in one of the most moronic ways possible \u2013 enemies just get more armour and more HP making it a sluggish grind of \"get grouped behind covers / engage single enemy / focus fire for several turns.. next\". All this to find out that in the next mission the crab you had to kill in 2 turns of focus fire now requires 4 turns. This is by far the greatest flaw with this game for me and I will not play further.\n\nStory is just silly and will take some serious suspension of disbelief to get on with. \nFor example:\nWe are told that virus / mutants have world oceans with unchallenged access to >90% of all biosphere. This is game over resource-wise before we even start. They can literally zerg rush the surface with effectively unlimited biomass.\nWith motley crew of three, after long and perilous journey we take back a base that was overrun by mutants. Really? Who was manning the base before, local church choir? Nonetheless [i]\u201cgood news everyone\u201d[/i], at least we now have a military base so there should be decent stock of weapons and munitions we can use. Well sorry but no, mutants ate it all already, lucky for us they left the plane for desert and we were just in time to save it.\n\nMinor pet peeves:\n\n[i]What did you shoot him with, an air rifle?[/i] (Rory Breaker, Lock, Stock and..)\n\nWeapons are not realistic. It feels as if the soldiers are shooting .22LR at best, not military calibre ammo. I really-really hate this \u201cpaper bullets\u201d game design. I\u2019d like to see 7.62 FMJs blowing crabs apart like a rotten watermelons they are.\nAnd unlike XCOMs there is no obvious weapon upgrade tree ([i]skip the lasers - go for plasma![/i]) - we are stuck with paintball guns.\n\nGlobal map has a lot going on but very little you can do about it. Diplomacy is non-existent. Tech tree seems to lack impact and generally choices feel meaningless.\n\nGood points -  none.\nAnd as for first-person aiming, nice try but no cigar. In this game it adds little value as the player is forced to use it because the other \"old\" way of shooting is horrible.\n\nP.S.\nThere is still a niche for a bug-hunt game in XCOM settings, ideally cross of Incubation(1997) and Firaxis XCOM for modern graphics.", "timestamp_created": 1607613483, "timestamp_updated": 1607615851, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81983845": {"recommendationid": "81983845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059667132", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1606, "last_played": 1613189674}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok so ...

Overall:\nThe game at first looked good, but it became boring very fast. Maps are short wich make for combat to end pretty quickly so just have 2 soldiers on the front and snipers on the back and congratulations you can beat the game easily. Do note that you may encounter a lot if bugs, some that can make a mission impossible to complete, and the game can crash from time to time, sadly the game is not on beta so....... \n\nGameplay: Free aim is a neat little feature that allow you to disable an arm or a leg but..... it gets old rather quickly along the rest of the game. The game allow you to manage your soldiers inventory but you won't get to equip a lot of things like ammo, flashbang grenades, etc etc etc, heck you can't even customize your weapons. Vehicles sounds good but they are not that good since a vehicle can take up to 3 soldiers space and you can't reload vehicles.\n\nCustomization: Very inferior to what XCOM 2 can offer, and the VA of soldiers is really bad.\n\nReplayability: Unless you've played on a lower difficulty there is no real replayability unless you are waiting for the paid DLC.\n\nStory: I find the story boring, ennemies are boring too wich doesn't help, like in XCOM 2 the story was good and the Chosen was a neat addition because they added some voicelines while on the overmap, here there is mostly just the the music.\n\nMusic: It's pretty forgetful, so it's pretty bad to be honest, I'm not asking for some DOOM music but you should play some music and mute the music of the game.\n\nI'll give this game a 2/10, there was some ideas but they didn't put efforts in it, and I know that they could have done much better since I'm a playtester, they just had no will to make a good game or something, especialy since the game have a lot of bugs, if there was a steam workshop and the community made the game better then sure, but the game is not even worth 25$, the full price is 50$ so you know that they want more players (under 5000 players right now) when at release on steam they sell it at -50%, but they'll probably sell the DLC overpriced.", "timestamp_created": 1607521054, "timestamp_updated": 1608034387, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45027470588684082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81884203": {"recommendationid": "81884203", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969731286", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1487, "last_played": 1608920194}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant strategy and buildup game, you can do what ever way that you want, and if you  are not ready for the chaos that come mid-game you have more difficulty in surviving, and you cant save everybody.  that seems to be the lesson in this game.  but you can try and you will fail.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1607508805, "timestamp_updated": 1607508805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81883449": {"recommendationid": "81883449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031704654", "num_games_owned": 409, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 995, "last_played": 1607494215}, "language": "english", "review": "The parts where Phoenix Point shines aren't enough to overshadow the parts where it lacks. 4/10\n\nThe whole premise behind this game had me hooked from the start. A new take on the moderately done to death alien invasion made me think \"Yeah, this one will be a good one!\"... Then they went Epic Exclusive for a year, so I forgot about it. Was browsing my queue and it popped up and I decided to grab it. Now, it was 50% off, but still cost me $42.47 AUD ([i] like 21 bunnings snags, very expensive [/i]), would definitely not buy it at full price. I was expecting to get maybe 80 hours of fun out of this one, but I got to about 16 before it was just too much to bear.\n\n[h1] COMBAT [/h1]\nThe Good\n- The combat is decent. The whole aim cone system is new and cool.\n- The body part targeting and health pools was fairly well done (though I feel like if you disable somebody's head it should kill them...)\n- The action points are good, both in design and utilisaion. Moving 1m only uses a portion of the action point bar, which was something I appreciated, compared to newCOM where you move a step and oops you only have 1AP left.\n\nThe Bad\n- The aiming needs some sort of indicator (like for example, A PERCENTAGE), because just because I can see the tip of somebody's arm doesn't mean I should necessarily shoot at it. When the cover is blocking 95% of the enemy but the camera angle makes it look like its a good shot, I find myself always checking the free aim then being disappointed. Maybe putting a red tinge to obstacles in the aim cone or something might've helped.\n- Cover feels overpowered and useless at the same time. Full cover protects you from most attacks while half cover feels like it does nothing.\n- YOU CAN'T EQUIP A SHIELD AND A PISTOL AT THE SAME TIME LIKE WTF\n\n[h1] OVERALL [/h1]\nThe Good\n- The Pandorans (the main enemy) feel fresh and interesting, and the way they evolve is pretty cool.\n\nThe Bad\n- The Geoscape map feels kinda clunky, and I don't really have an explanation as to why.\n- I had multiple instances of cinematics just failing to play, or just freezing mid way through.\n- I'm not a fan of the geopolitical shenanigans that are going on. I just want to be able to help humanity best as I can, but it feels like the game is forcing you to pick and choose between the factions, and I hate how the diplomacy missions are to attack the other factions. It feels like the game actively punishes you if you aren't attacking or stealing resources or aircraft from the different factions.\n- The inventory management. I feel like they decided for a simple design when they shouldn't have. Xenonauts did the inventory management really well imo, it had an infinite number of standard equipment - projectile firearms, grenades ect that you could just chuck on your new recruits. Oh whats that, you hired a new guy? Too bad you don't have any weapons/armor for him to use. That'll be 500 materials and 9 days to fully equip them.\n- The research felt more like a check list than progression. In Xenonauts and newCOM you started with projectile weapons, worked your way through to get laser and plasma weapons or whatever, but it doesn't seem like that's there for Phoenix Point. No, you gotta steal it from the factions or be allied with them to get access to research it. And half the time the newer stuff is barely an upgrade. Not a fan.\n- There's probably more I could add here but these were the main things that came to mind.\n\nAt the end of the day, I probably over-hyped this game for myself and expected way too much. It honestly felt like I was playing an early access game. Maybe it gets better later into the game but it just ended up feeling like a chore that I didn't want to invest my time into. I'm sure there are plenty of people that are having a blast with this game, but I just couldn't get into it. Maybe I'll come back later and have a better time with it, who knows.\n[strike] ALSO YOU CAN'T EQUIP THE SHIELD AND A PISTOL AT THE SAME TIME WTF.

This is a cautious negative, should be a neutral.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nDespite carrying the \"XCOM\" name on its description as means of comparison, it diverges heavily from modern XCOM, and not in a good or bad way. Problem is, sometimes it could've done better by diverging more. Story is about the same, even bugs feel like imported from the newest XCOM games. [b]\"Full Controller Support\" is a HUGE LIE[/b].\n\n[h1]\"I don't know what 'XCOM' is\"[/h1]\n(if you do, skip this part)\nShort answer is: XCOM is a tactical game where asset management is crucial, strategy is multilayered (long term plans are important, but instant execution is the bread and butter), and gameplay is divided in two equally important parts: real time strategy with base and resource management; and turn-based battles with units.\nXCOM reputation comes from the second part. A HUGE part of XCOM difficulty lays in the heavy randomness of battles, and how damage balancing can make a single enemy shot shift the whole battle (against or in favor of the player). When you see memes about \"normal person seeing 95% *happy*, XCOM player seeing 95% *nervous sweating*\", that ain't a joke. Even a unit that is on full cover can be critically hit by an alien, die, set the whole team in panic, and have everyone else killed because of that. In XCOM, any mistake can be a mission ending mistake. And when training human assets is a long and arduous job, that is the kind of commitment  you make on every mission. You are never safe from the Random Number Generator on XCOM, no matter how safe you play. And playing too safe is not only boring and bad for the player, but there are also mechanics that prevent or punish that.\nNow...\n\n[h1]\"I know what XCOM is, so what does Phoenix Point changes?\"[/h1]\nShort answer is: way less luck-reliant on the turn-based battles with units.\nOn XCOM finding an enemy triggers a cutscene, gives them a free-turn to prepare against you, and makes your regret ever advancing your team? Not on Phoenix Point! When moving, if a unit finds an enemy, they just stop. And on Phoenix Point, actions are divided into \"Action Points\" that have about nothing to do with \"points\", since they are not discrete. A 10 tile movement costs one action point? Then 5 tiles is 0.5 action points. And if you stop because you spotted an enemy, no action points are lost. Upon spotting, you can prepare yourself, or even retreat.\nThe rest of the battle-related things are just as advertised. While the success of a strategy on XCOM can heavily be dictated on luck, on Phoenix Point a properly laid out plan is a definitive win.\nThese two main differences aren't good or bad, these are what differentiates XCOM from Phoenix Point. If the dependence on RNG on XCOM early game has always turned you down, Phoenix Point might just become your best friend. Specially since damage is balanced in a way that even on early game, all units (yours and enemies) can soak more than a single bullet before dying.\n\n[h1]\"OK, now what is the same or hasn't changed significantly?\"[/h1]\nSimilar to XCOM 2, your initial position is less of a \"world savior\" and more of the \"underdog\", with not only XCOM being the only faction fighting aliens. Except that in Phoenix Point they had the great writing and backstory to make the player even more of an underdog and make the factions more significant by portraying them as \"as capable of being the solution against the aliens, as Phoenix Point might be\", creating a more interesting world. BUT INSTEAD, you're appointed as \"world savior\" by the initial narration, and factions are very receptive of you. There is barely any animosity between them and you, unless you pick a fight. Huge missed opportunity here, to create an even wider difference from XCOM while ALSO making it stand better on itself. Also, the voice acting is kinda bad, and it's not the \"so bad its good\"-bad, it's the \"bland\"-bad. Some key persons have great VAs, but soldier barks are generically devoid of emotion. Actors seem fine, but VA direction seems incapable. These compounded problems (too much centralization on the player and bad VA) degraded the potential of having a more complex and more interesting story when compared to XCOM's \"you're awesome Commander, now go save the world\". Again, if Phoenix Point made this actually work, it wouldn't make it \"better\" than XCOM, it would've made it unique.\nThe management side is slightly different from XCOM, being a little more straining and complex, with 3 main resource types (instead of just \"Cash\" and \"Expropriated Alien Stuff\"). Instead of randomly appearing missions, you have several places to visit and maybe find resources, battles, or just information. Weaving of the DLCs was improperly made, with time-limited-unique-do-now-or-never missions (or at least that how they appear to be) that appear on early game and pit you against enemies you barely have any chance against (praised be my two snipers, only two capable of damaging those dang missile-shooting heavies). Mission variety overall is actually very good, and layouts fluctuate from more open fields with few buildings to more cramped places. Except for alien nests. Artificially and unnecessarily cramped! Yay. Gonna leave a review on Yelp.\n\n[h1]\"OK, I get it, but aren't you forgetting about something?\"[/h1]\nOH YEAH. BAD CONTROLLER SUPPORT!\nIf using a controller to play is important for you, and that [b]\"Full Controller Support\"[/b] made you smile, STOP... [b]STOP. RIGHT. NOW.[/b]\nI'm on a Dual Shock 4, forgot I had DS4Windows running, and when I saw the \"You seem to be using a mapping software *yadda yadda yadda* 'you don't need it' *yadda* *yadda* *yadda*\", it made me smile!\nThen, I closed the prompt, closed DS4Windows, opened the game again, and... controller unresponsive.\n\"Huh. Let's check options, sometimes you need to toggle controller use.\". It was already toggled. Controller totally unresponsive.\n\"Well, sometimes you need to restart the PC. Shouldn't, but let's try\". Nothing.\n\"Well, Steam Controller Configuration Support might be on, and it might need to be off (or the other way)\". Nope.\n\"...back to what I know to use then.\" DS4Windows just works.\n\"Great, now let's see how well it's adapted to controller\". BADLY.\nXCOM has a cursor bug where when changing characters, the cursor doesn't update the position, so when selecting another character and trying to move the cursor, camera whips back to the last position at full speed. That bug is also on Phoenix Point! They didn't bother to update cursor position on character change too (or messed the script the same way)! But wait, there new stuff too! Sometimes it warps outside the playing area, and you simply CAN'T bring it back because you can't move the cursor when its outside the play area! Also, there is no \"floor selection\", and the cursor doesn't \"climb\" walls, so trying to select a direction that is on another floor is an adventure in itself, since you need to position the cursor relative to the camera in a way that is targeting the tile on the upper floor you want to go, even if one tile to the \"side\" (camera relative) is completely off from the that upper floor tile. Trust me, it's BAD.\nAlso, the rest of the UI+UX is AWFUL for controller. CAN'T use D-Pad for menus (worst part). Sometimes lacks UI helpers telling what button does what. And the cherry on top, is that the UI is heavily cursor-dependent. I cry in anger every time I see \"Full Controller Support\" and that actually means \"you use your controller to badly mimic a mouse, because we couldn't bother doing better than that\".\nOh yeah, and the cursor is huge plus is always visible on cutscenes.\nPlease, don't say your game has \"Full Controller Support\" if XInput isn't supported out-of-the-box. It makes the disappointment of dredging through bad UI+UX with a controller even worse.", "timestamp_created": 1607492133, "timestamp_updated": 1607492249, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460830926895141602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81875317": {"recommendationid": "81875317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137661361", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1118, "last_played": 1607658744}, "language": "english", "review": "i likey", "timestamp_created": 1607491936, "timestamp_updated": 1607491936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460704594850540161", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81875283": {"recommendationid": "81875283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194470546", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169, "last_played": 1607564942}, "language": "english", "review": "Is X-COM 2 WotC better? Does it stand up to that game and more in the genre? This is a question you'll probably be asking before you buy. Especially since the product is advertised as being made by someone that's been in the industry for a long time. Yes and no, it's a little complicated.\n\nThis is the Year One Edition, so you'll get some nice DLC to go with it. This also means it is priced the same as the other big turn based strategy games of this genre.\n\nIt's hard to beat X-COM's WotC, but that will definitely put a hole in your pocket compared to this game. I got it on sale for $30. For that price Pheonix Point is worth it. But how about when it is not on sale? This will depend on a few things and how you feel about them:\n\nThere are a few nice QoL things that I've gotten used to from XCOM 2, like being able to move multiple soldiers at the same time and not waiting one-by-one. (This example is actually directly linked to another feature of this game, which is when a soldier is moving and that soldier spots a new enemy, they stop to let you decide what to do, which is nice.) From time to time I feel a little slowed down.\n\nSomething I like a lot is that if an attack hits or misses is not entirely up to an RNG machine. YOU have free aim of the shot your soldier is taking. The way you shoot is similar to hip-firing in an FPS, the bullets are randomly spread in a circle. No more shooting 6 bullets with a 99% chance and missing a point-blank target. You can prioritize different body parts, which can be disabled to hinder the target in different ways. The cover you and the enemy takes is also a lot more of a factor than half/full, as is the angle your shooting from. Maybe just part of your arm is sticking out from a wall, or an enemy is flanking you from the other side of a window and just your head can be seen. Very cool system overall and I feel more in control.\n\nThere are a few other factions that you interact with throughout the campaign. The stance you take with one effects how others react. You can help and hurt relations between the factions with decisions you make. You can even attack and defend the bases these factions have. Very cool.\n\nGraphically there is a little to desire, but it isn't off-putting. The art is familiar to, you guessed it, X-COM. When it is advertised as being made by the X-COM creator, you fight an 'alien' force like in X-COM, and it looks like X-COM, it is hard not to compare the two during play.\n\nI have not played long enough to notice and long-term cons to the game. It is pretty good, but overall not amazing. Grab it if its on sale.

Like raising shield, froggy melee life drain attack, mind fragger face hug, worm bombs, Big guy stompping in your faces.\n\nWhy I said that is cheating? because you could Mind Control them: YOU CANT, need AP.\nSo, this end up dev team sit back there and ask you to suffer as if they feel this is fun.\nCombine with  new stamina cost by turn taken up to 10.\n\nThis game turned into forced to be bored but saft tactic and back and go to base to sleep like we watching enough like crouch potato then: Ah, we can finally have a fight. Oh, men but just to brawling like a old men because you wont like the RnG to jump your face and lose a elite.\n\n3.\nYES, goddamn nerfing us like all days. The thing we had just like something CAN do but NOT GOOD AT it.\n\nIs dash OP? look at a crab men dash into your face and hit then back like 8 tile THEN raise the shield While there is like 8+ out there and endless reinforcement incoming And the Time not on your side.\n\nDo anyone think the rageshot exist after turn into fan-speared shot? \nwhat is that for? \nteamkilling your guy? or asking you walk into a big guy and us it? on something that 2600+ HP? \n\nAnd you even killed the phoenix cannon into a big crappy 3-chained shot to nerfing it.\nIt cant penetrate cover, harder to do damage, \nlowed the shred just for the feeling of the new rage shot like something barrage shot.\n\nAll we got in the year is about nerfing the old content and leave the room for the DLC content.\n\nYes, 1 AP melee+ onslaught  + 100% stealth STILL there.\n\n\nI know there are broken thing there ON BOTH SIDE. \nHOW ABOUT make the thing right? \n\nDo you know mist head froggy can 0AP creating 4*4 mist two time in one round,\nBefore you 50 with syni, you are mad to use grenades to clear the mist.\nAnd... \nLair fight turn into unplayable. My map turn into mist in 4 turn. Thanks to 4 froggy men...\n\nAll they cheating and sit there misting and misting....\nHow about nerf that? into 2AP cost and 1*1 mist?\nYou know the mist tower can only one time casting in one turn for 2*2. \nThen what the hell in the world a froggy with the mushroom head can wild going like this?\n\nI met this shit a year ago, AND IT STILL THERE! \n\nand the dev team ONLY try to deny any way we try to rush the lair fight because this is boring and dangerous and meaningless to run in maze and get face-danced by those seafoods.\n\n4.\nOWing is aim for the head. \nThis is unfairing and stupid.\nwhy is it?\nthere are two thing:\n\nFirst.\nHuman all like going to the party standing tall and high.\nCrabs are humpbacked, frog and siren are crouching.\n\nSo, OW enemy are just asking your men to shot the cover.\nBecause when man saw and OW a crab, He saw a leg AND HE SHOT the HEAD where still in the cover.\nAnd there is no such thing for the enemy side.

This makes each battle very dynamic with its own challenges.  \n\nI do have some gripes with this game, its been worked on for so long, yet it continues to lack certain physical elements to it. \n\n-Doors don't open, they disappear. \n-When heavy's use their jets, their guns disappear from their hands and hang from their butts. \n-They made the dash ability use an action point in addition to will, this diminishes its usefulness quite a bit (granted this was changed long long ago, I'm still bitter about that though) \n-augmentations are limited to two parts of the body instead of three. This is one of the most frustrating aspects for me. There is no reason for this. most of the time when augmenting , you get this awkward looking soldier that has a huge head and body, and these tiny stick legs. Snapshot seems to refuse to change this. \n-the music is boring and depressing when it could have been an action theme like x-com\n-there is a lack of life in your bases and characters (admittedly they added a couple of characters in the beginning, but they don't seem to play a role in the rest of the game)\n\nall in all, if you like tactics, this game is definitely very focused on tactics, that's what makes it fun.", "timestamp_created": 1607453623, "timestamp_updated": 1607527189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614707589149475098", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81849048": {"recommendationid": "81849048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051634732", "num_games_owned": 511, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1608385561}, "language": "english", "review": "Never have I felt both eternal dread an pleasure at the same time when playing a video game.

I also wanted to let everyone know that I was an original backer of this game but got a refund due to the unacceptable switch to EGS and the ensuing debacle.\n\nSo for the review, it seems much more polished than some of the earlier builds. However, this is not to the level of XCOM 2, which many reviewers have compared it to. If you have gotten this far into the review and think this game looks fun to play and do not have XCOM 2, do yourself a favor and get that one instead. \n\nI like the free aim mechanic and how overwatch isn't an automatic win anymore. I like the different factions working with or against you and not at the player's whim like in other games. I also like the true to lore cutscenes and story. The research chains and technologies give you the incentive to work hard to be diplomatic with the other factions and balance your late game needs. Having the option to raid for tech or aircraft was a nice touch as well. There are many, many different ways you can play depending on how you balance these mechanics. This ensures no two games are the same. \n\nI think a number of the classes need to be rebalanced as a sniper/heavy or sniper/assault builds are much more useful than any of the other ones. I also think that the havens you need to defend should have buildable point defenses, so you don't have to keep fighting over and over and over. In my first game, I fought almost 70 haven defense battles within a 23-hour game. It felt needlessly tedious. Most of the maps are very similar, even the major story or faction missions. I'd like to see more variety there as well. I never felt compelled to care about any of my soldiers either, like XCOM.  More customization features are needed. \n\nLastly, I think there has been a waste regarding some of the factions there. You fight the Pure and Forsaken, but have very little interaction otherwise. Similarly, the bandit and independent factions have such promise and have not been expanded on very much either. Why can you not choose to work with either? There could be special technologies and other consequences for relations with the main factions. If the developers read the reviews, they should use more of the very rich lore background. I hope the new DLCs fix these things. \n\nI'd give it a lukewarm thumbs-up, a 7/10.

If I could give it a maybe I would but honestly, if you're a fan of XCOM style games, this is a good one to try. It's a turn based squad based tactical strategy game with all the bells and whistles that you'd expect from the man who originally created the X-COM series. If you don't have XCOM 2 and are thinking about getting into Turn Based Tactics games then start with XCOM 2 over this. If you're a fan, like myself, go ahead and give it a try.\n\nPROS\n-Good combat and aiming system. The \"Free Aim\" should be a standard in all future XCOM titles.\n-4 AP points that can be spent in any order is fantastic. No longer do you need to decide if you run and shoot, shot and stay, or just run.\n-Vehicles are a great addition that would be a great addition in XCOM 3.\n-Exploration around the Geoscape feels much better than exploration in XCOM2. The ability to send out multiple parties and having multiple bases is a must have.\n-The ability to cross class and level up your characters in a pseudo RPG style way is fantastic.\n\nCONS\n-Progression feels incredibly slow. You can speed this up by spamming out research labs and trying to steal from factions but direct and indirect aggression towards other factions seems like a poor choice for the player in general.\n-Faction interaction needs to be stronger. In my 25 hours of playing I have rarely found any real benefits from directly attacking factions to gain favor from another or steal technology. The Pandoran attacks on Havens are INCREDIBLY plentiful and will boost relations with factions easily. Destruction of Pandoran Nests, Lairs, and Citadels also helps build relation with all 3 factions.\n-Vehicles need to be improved. While they are a great addition, they feel somewhat like a poor choice. A vehicle will never improve over a soldier and taking one in the field means leaving three soldiers behind. They are technically the cheaper and economic choice over fielding a soldier and their equipment, but their benefits don't outweigh a full squad of operatives.\n-Aircraft needs to be improved. There seems to be little reason to use other faction aircraft when the Phoenix standard is cheap and quick. You can always field multiple strikecraft as well, allowing you multiple teams to be stationed around the world for rapid response.\n-Enemy progression is horrific. I am personally unsure if I am being punished for doing good but it seems every operation creates a new Pandoran mutation. The enemy techs up faster than I can, forcing me to devolve into tactics like leaning heavily on snipers and grenade launchers. Standard gear becomes almost useless as well as gear that lacks pierce.\n-Character customization is just... pretty bad. It's not like XCOM where you can make your friends, family, and coworkers into perfect avatars. Customization here is bland and the VA work is not that hot either. Units feel less like characters I care about and more like pieces on a board with little to no personality.\n\nHOW IT CAN IMPROVE\n-Better diplomacy. Give me a reason to stab someone in the back or support one faction over the other. With how often Havens are attacked there is almost no reason to take a hostile action towards other factions besides roleplaying.\n-Improve customization for obvious reasons.\n-Have a way for the weapons race to actually keep up with the Pandorans. You always feel like you're several steps behind, forcing you to use somewhat cheesy tactics and combos just to win. Maybe that's what they're going for but it doesn't feel balanced like XCOM.\n-WORKSHOP! You want your game to survive and thrive like XCOM? That's how you do it. If you can't fix the problem with a patch or new content then let us do it ourselves.\n\nFun game, wish I didn't have to wait the extra year to play it due to the EGS acquisition. I supported it on kickstarter and hope to see this game improve and grow with plenty of support from the team.\n", "timestamp_created": 1607420106, "timestamp_updated": 1607420106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81826380": {"recommendationid": "81826380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024138745", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 964, "last_played": 1607511175}, "language": "english", "review": "Slow start but good game", "timestamp_created": 1607418404, "timestamp_updated": 1607418404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81823448": {"recommendationid": "81823448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290544042", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 883, "playtime_at_review": 1944, "last_played": 1619187052}, "language": "english", "review": "much more better now", "timestamp_created": 1607412834, "timestamp_updated": 1619105763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81823269": {"recommendationid": "81823269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045179645", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1144, "last_played": 1607414990}, "language": "english", "review": "Sorry nope.

Not even remotely so. While it has a number of interesting ideas and a decent setting, it was created with a number of really important flaws - flaws that weren't really addressed by all the patches and DLCs even to this day.\n\nProblem #1: strategic layer is very primitive, lacks important decisions, and overall quite unfun. Strategic layer is the backbone of XCOM-styled games: while most of the in-game time is spent resolving tactical battles, it's strategic layer that allows these battles to be truly different by providing varied constraints (wounded soldiers, logistical issues, etc) and benefits (tech options, loadouts, locations, and so on). And in Phoenix Point - most of strategic aspects are very barebone.\nThe tech tree isn't really a \"tree\", more like a patch of grass with lots of side options but barely any power levels or game-changing implements - and thus, the loadouts that you can take on missions are rather boring and uninventive and typically based on abusing certain game mechanic loopholes.\nThe soldiers are absolutely not unique but at the same time very limited in the highest power level they can achieve, so the game fails both nuCOM approach (soldiers are reasonably unique snowflakes) and oldCOM (soldiers are nearly equal redshirts, but you can often win with quantity if not quality). In Phoenix Point, your soldiers are nameless mooks that stay nameless and easily replaceable all the way through the game; yet battles are so small-scaled and clamped so that abusing superior numbers in any way is simply denied by game rules.\nAll other strategic aspects are similarly bland - while the globe view looks very busy all the time, you don't really get to make many important choices there, most of the time you just grab the shiniest thing of them all (solider/resource/ship/etc that you need the most right now), and that's it.\n\nProblem #2: tactical combat is badly scaled and its basic mechanics are underdeveloped. nuCOM games with their dice rolls for hits were able to easily balance map scale issues by just tweaking numbers, but with Phoenix Point and it's free aim feature it became a big issue quite immediately after the release, and devs only offered small balance patches to an absolutely huge problem.\nIn simple terms, small maps and free aim to-hit system makes rules of engagement utterly unrealistic and extremely \"gamey\". Right after the release, the god-tier weapon in the entire game was your starting heavy cannon, simply due to the fact that it's the highest-damaging \"normal\" weapon, and you could stack aim bonuses on it to turn into a de-facto sniper rifle, much more powerful that normal sniper rifles. It was patched to a certain degree eventually, but the problems that allowed that issue to happen are all still there, and later engagements are still mostly about your soldiers standing at the edge of the map (if line of sight allows) and firing through the entire map. Cover is irrelevant. Clever positioning is irrelevant. Tactical movement is irrelevant. All that's relevant is reaching certain breakpoints on damage (to deal with enemy armor) and stacking enough accuracy to hit things from whatever range.\nThe core of this problem is the fact that you can't easily tweak spread values (or very simplistic damage/armor values) to make weapons ranging from sniper rifles to shotguns [b]all[/b] play nicely at the same time on very small maps and versus rather dumb enemy AI. Even with primitive tech tree and no power levels, the basic mechanics of hitting targets and dealing damage are STILL not complex enough to accomodate all the weapons there are in the game.\n\nProblem #3: the story is... severely underwhelming in its presentation. I don't expect too much from an XCOM-style game, but what's presented in Phoenix Point breaks the suspension of disbelief all too much. You're the humanity's savior, but it does seem like nobody (except you) cares about upcoming extinction - in fact, the factions are more than happy to speed it up by warring among themselves. Worse still, while it seems like the most pressing issue for the most part of the game - [b]you cannot do anything about it.[/b] Indeed, just resolve the crisis before all these morons kill each other. It's what they pay you for, after all (except they don't).\nSo even if you play though the game and fight through the crabby crisis - you're still saving only a bunch of morons that are quite actively suicidal on their own. It's quite anti-spectacular and anti-climactic on all the fronts.\n\nPS: And oh yes - while DLCs bring some additional content, they do so in a very parceled way, not really meshing it together with the main campaign, and thus present no more than a tiny band-aid to the game's deep problems.", "timestamp_created": 1607366819, "timestamp_updated": 1607368958, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 178, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.805927634239196777", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81796367": {"recommendationid": "81796367", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972537030", "num_games_owned": 658, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 153, "last_played": 1607366288}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just like the original XCOM from 1994 - Ambitious, complex, with fascinating new mechanics and fresh ideas. \n\nAnd just like the original XCOM it is a buggy, half-finished mess.

I never played Phoenix Point upon release over a year ago, as I just chose not to bother and I had read all the reports of it being buggy and unpolished... so for any TBS- tactical/strategy combo fans, here are my early thoughts after playing a weekend. \n\nOverall, it's better than Phantom Doctrine, but still not as 'tight' as War of the Chosen, even though it has, IMHO stronger strategy features than the 'ability-battle-puzzle' board-game-ness style of modern XCOM.\n\n - The ballistics modeling replacing RNG is actually a way bigger feature than I anticipated, and I like it a lot. It really changes the battle mechanics. Unlearn XCOM - cover doesn't 'reduce damage', there are no critical hits in Phoenix Point, there is no RNG(!) (though there is a standard distribution for effective range), there is manual targeting system (Fallout 3/4 VATs-like) for specific body parts and damage. Once I saw the gameplay perspective, it wasn't a gimmick, it's cool - e.g. flanking an enemy allows you to target the arm holding the enemy's shield, and you destroy it then your 'heavy' that the enemy was previously blocking against can shoot un-impeded.\n\n- Soldiers are way more customizable from a gameplay perspective, there's multi-classing and a lot more paths for designing a character and squad synergy (it's different than the the kind of ability-permutation combinations that XCOM does). To me, this is highly preferable. However both XCOM and Phoenix Point still suffer from not giving 'personality' to your soldiers, though Chimera Squad did this best at the cost of customizability.\n\n - The story is like a combination of eldritch horror and terror from the deep. The tropes are simple (a jingoistic para-military faction, a religious zealot faction, crab people), so even though the plot doesn't have me going there is some intriguing lore if you like reading between button-based-decision choices. Voice acting and music do nothing to bring you into the game, and it doesn't feel as epic as XCOM but I appreciate a lot of the story-lets; they're better than the one-off events in XCOM (except for Newfoundland, that was epic).\n\n - The evolving enemies seems interesting; but I haven't seen the impact of this yet. It's more jumps in the enemy power curve than XCOM (e.g. when Muton Elites start appearing it's such a huge jump). It has the impact of changing your tactics over the course of the game which is cool. At the beginning, all enemy units are melee so they charge you - so you can just sit hold tight and kill from a distance and it seems overly easy, but then they start getting ranged attacks (but unpredict-ably of different types) and your own tactics change.... it's neat.\n\n - The strategy level is way more complex than XCOM, welcomingly so. You have to manage multiple bases, there are multiple resource types, facilities with different buffs accruing over time, and multiple squads via multiple dropships flying around the map. There's a light diplomacy layer and a surprisingly necessary-not-superfluous trade/economic layer. It's not presented as well as it could be in the UI, but it's as deep as any RTS (the Geoscape is 'real-time with pause').\n\n - Tactical battles are tighter, on smaller maps, and quicker than XCOM (so far). Early-game combat is less lethal than vanilla XCOM, medium-game (and I anticipate late) is more-so. There seems more flexibility at the tactical level, since there are time units (old school!), you can move-shoot-move, move-move, or shoot-shoot, etc. It has vehicles on the tactical level, which are implemented better than SHIVs from XCOM:EU, and supposedly the next DLC adds air warfare which I am intrigued by.", "timestamp_created": 1607360046, "timestamp_updated": 1607360046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562528848648071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81790007": {"recommendationid": "81790007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799335762", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 701, "last_played": 1607536826}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a cool game which fans of the Xcom games will also enjoy in my opinion.

Q: Should you buy this game? A: Yes. Q: Is it worth the money? Yes especially if you buy it now while it\u2019s discounted on steam. Q: Will you still be playing it a few years from now? A: Yes I\u2019m pretty sure I will as it has a lot of  replayability built into it. Now to the details. I was one of the game\u2019s original backers, but I opted to wait until the steam release when it went Epic exclusive (yes I was pretty annoyed about it at the time) and so it\u2019s pretty much a brand new game from my perspective. Nearly 50 hours in and I have not encountered a single bug either major or minor and it seems completely stable at least on my system. The graphics are not as pretty and the production values not as high as its nearest direct comparison XCOM2, but it does a lot of things that game failed to do. I\u2019ve heard the bullet mechanics described by one streamer as \u201cgimmicky\u201d but actually I think they work really well. Shoot your enemies from behind walls & destroy buildings and cover with your heavies. Target specific body parts and more. No more misses at point blank range as most of the time you are almost guaranteed at least a partial hit with a spray of bullets. Overall the combat feels quite meaty as opposed to the cartoonish feel of XCOM2. It also has quite a deep back story too with a whole range of novellas tied to the main storyline. Essentially the game a big sandbox with a lot of randomization in terms of starting points and the resources available to you so every time you start a new game you will have a slightly different experience.  I love the way that the game allows you to pursue so many different strategies and paths to victory, giving you maximum versatility in how develop your troops.

Worse yet is slowly learning the terrible issues and choices were on purpose/by design, highlighted immensely by the absolute absurdity of the games last mission. The game DEMANDS meta knowledge even on the easiest difficulty. Contrary to what was advertised at a point in the past, enemies have zero responsive or adaptive skills, and instead get full power increases, leaving a hodgepodge of seemingly powerful and useless enemies, which is swiftly countered ONLY in the last mission, where a immense compliment of powerful, perfectly picked units will annihilate you repeatedly. This is the first time in my life I have reached so close to an end of a game, and just given up, completely uninterested in whatever ending this game's mediocre plot brings. Main game aside, the DLC is an absolute joke, Blood and Titanium  gives unmaintainable and irreplaceable augments to soldiers, while introducing two new factions, one that is pathetically weak, and one that is immensely powerful early game, and for some reason is the only one you can wipe out, for no reward. Living weapons DLC gives trivial side missions that grant you a piece of the set per mission, straight up 100% better gear than anything else in the game, just because. Legacy of the ancients, so immensely tedious that I lost interest in investing the soldiers and effort almost immediately, despite the hanging carrot of powerful gear, which also require a generic side mission per piece. It also introduces new, even more powerful enemies, and unique mechanical beings that only exist when looking for the new gear and material for it. The game is also riddled with bugs, some of which are very noticable, and some which have been around for what appears to have been a long time now. I tried so hard to like this game and man did I want to, and for a little while i did, but there was a ever growing pile of garbage forming, and it all collapses in near endgame. Some of this garbage includes a tech tree designed by a psychopath, and very poor design for inter-faction interactions, that and the ever looming death clock which your AI allies are more than happy to bring closer and closer to zero by fighting each other regardless of player interaction. The game is also happy to give you pop ups of information that won't show you where that thing is happening, and gatekeep progress unless you posses what you would think would be an optional vehicle. Also if it has not been said, the difficulty setting for the game does not actually do anything for combat, meaning anyone who wanted to play this game with any degree of ease will not get it. Combat in this game, with its unique aiming mechanic, is quite fun, when it works. However there are plenty of occasions where you the player, can abuse mechanics, and if YOU don't the AI will. This game holds absolutely zero punches, and will punish you to its best ability with the randomly chosen units, once again highlighted in the final mission. Keep in mind I didn't make it past the first few enemies of the last mission even, getting curb stomped repeatedly once turning the wall to face the \"gatekeepers\" From what I have heard the final boss is also a \"beautifully\" designed creature, with excellent mechanics that definitely do not require further meta knowledge. I had spent a solid 6 hours getting smacked hard by this mission, despite missions elsewhere being a cake walk, enemies in normal random missions have zero organization, despite plenty of flavour text implying there is some. The game's inventory system, which at first seemed nice, devolved into not being able to bring enough things with you, including ammunition, once again highlighted in the final mission, where specifically chosen units burned through entire clips in one ability, not even killing their target, get frozen in place and pin point sniped to death (in a single turn). So much for all the things they carried with them, because your other units are also frozen in place, which as far as I had seen has no way to resist (unless you own the blood and titanium DLC and give them the heavy legs, but that requires meta knowledge). The game's combat also comes with a limb damage system, which again at first seemed really cool, until you learn how heavily enemies will abuse it. For starters, human characters have a fixed, considerably low limb health, and losing a single arm makes most soldiers useless for the rest of the mission. Better yet, enemies get incremental upgrades to their own limb health, and their armor too, way past what your own soldiers get. This is also replicated in their weapons, where their standard soldiers end up with either a large amount of armor, and a powerful machine gun and body shield, or a gun and grenade launcher, or four arms which regenerate, wielding late powerful sniper rifles, also including them having specific forms that are essentially completely invisible, requiring soldiers be within three tiles to spot. Normally this, despite its absurdity, can be compensated, however once again, I know, they decide you should fight two living artillery guns that negate all movement, four/five foot soldiers equipped with their highest tier gear that require a full soldiers turn to maybe kill one of them, four invisible pinpoint accurate soldiers, two top level super powered boss monsters, with complementing abilities, letting them stun your characters reducing actions to 1 instead of 4 (with the movement negation working with this too, also removing all character abilities) and one super armored super power psychic snake monster that can mind control your characters, al a excom, and also buff enemy movement by 50%. I know this review seems like a bit of a rant, because it kinda is, but seriously, I cannot overstate how much this game went into a full-on nosedive at end game. It almost makes you completely forget how bad the games tech progression, and other problems are. Everything boiled down into a slurry of repeated stomping right at the finish line that could have swayed my review to a mixed reception otherwise.

Cthulhu meets XCOM? Right in my wheelhouse (on both counts). Given I picked it up on EGS and played it a lot there and now paid actual money for another copy here, I must love it ... right? No. The potential for an amazing game is there, buried under some stupid design choices. Game balance issues are everywhere; from research to manufacturing to enemies ... everywhere and everything. \n\nThe difficulty curve is ridiculous. While you're grinding away trying to level up your soldiers so they're actually useful and trying to research weapons that actually might do some damage, the Pandorans constantly leapfrog ahead. The lazy answer to increasing enemy difficulty is to add HP and/or armour and that's what the devs decided to do in PP.\n\nYou very quickly and very easily find yourself in fights that can only be won in a brutal bloodbath that can cost you a fair chunk of your squad. That might be cool if it's a last stand against overwhelming odds, but not if it's because the enemy difficulty has just spiked up again and they've gained some ridiculous amount of HP and/or armour so your weapons barely scratch them. Oh, and don't believe the hype about 'true ballistics' (or whatever they call it). You'll miss. A lot. At critical times.\n\nIf a fraction of the XCOM modding universe directed their attention to PP to iron out some of the gameplay issues, and to build on what's already there, we could have something approaching the game this could be ... maybe should have been. I get the sense, though, that modding won't be a thing for two reasons: because the devs want to offer the same experience everywhere (no mods on EGS, so ... tough luck) and because of the EGS exclusivity on first release. The moment to capture the attention and affection of modders is when the game first comes out and that opportunity was lost. You only get one chance to make a first impression.\n\nI could drone on longer. I haven't even touched on the random squaddie skill generation that produces usable soldiers or worthless cannon fodder. The thing is, all of these issues existed through its time on EGS without being addressed. While, in fairness, I actually like the new tutorial, it makes no difference if it's the lead-in to a unbalanced game. Same with adding new DLC content.\n\nPhoenix Point is a glass either half full or half empty, depending on your point of view. It could be good, but isn't. It could be bad, but isn't.

While it takes a few cues from the Firaxis/2K reboot in its tactical / mission mode, its overview or \u2018geoscape\u2019 mode and accompanying strategic elements have at first glance been plucked right out of the 1994 original.\n\nIn many ways the game seems to walk the fine line of avoiding to infringe upon the IP trademarks and copyrights that are now held by the current owner of Mr Gollop\u2019s brainchild. \tThat which 2K/Firaxis incorporated into the reboot was left mostly untouched, while that which was left behind was picked up and brought back to life in Phoenix Point. It\u2019s an impressive feat: design a new game that doesn\u2019t infringe on the creator\u2019s lost IP by creating a new backstory, threat and tactical setup that still leaves plenty of room to give fans what they would expect from a spiritual successor to the 1994 classic \u2013 and to do so both believably and entertainingly.\n\nA few things that were reintroduced and enhanced in Phoenix Point;\n(that were sorely missed in the X-COM reboot):\n\n- free aiming (1): shoot at anything at any time to create a path\n- free aiming (2): aim for specific body parts to maximise damage and avoid armour.\n- multiple bases: multiple actual bases \u2013 with staff and facilities, not just aircraft hangars.\n- ranged stun weapons\n\nApart from that, the game features additional tactical layers (and accompanying difficulties / points of frustration) \u2013 such as destructible weapons and \u2018active\u2019 factions.\n\nDestructible weapons are a double edged sword... Players can target specific enemy body parts in the hopes of incapacitating them, effectively leaving an enemy defenceless. The same also holds true in reverse \u2013 get shot or touched (or sometimes it seems even looked at the wrong way) by an enemy and find your weapon destroyed. \n\nWhile the War of the Chosen DLC in 2016\u2019s XCOM 2 features a number of factions, they are anything but active and seem to purely exist passively at the behest of the player. In Phoenix Point however factions are akin to 1997\u2019s X-COM Apocalypse. They will either assist or actively seek conflict with the player as well as other factions \u2013 depending on both the players actions as well as the procedural elements in the game. \n\nGraphically I would put the game between Xenonauts and the 2012 reboot of X-COM. It is certainly a lot more polished than Xenonauts (including the upcoming Xenonauts 2 sequel) \u2013 but lacks the X-COM reboots deluxe camera effects, zoom levels, special effects and cutscenes - despite having superior textures and artwork. 2016\u2019s X-COM 2 however graphically trumps Phoenix Point in every possible way despite being 3 years older. The difference in development budget can clearly be seen on this front.\n\nAll in all \u2013 Phoenix Point is a great game and a worthy spiritual successor to the X-COM family of games. Potential players must realise though that Phoenix Point is not affiliated with the X-COM franchise in any way whatsoever. It is not a sequel, it shares none of the lore and backstory and thus should not be confused with X-COM in any way. It is a standalone game in the spirit of the original X-COM series as it was from 1994 to 1997 \u2013 made by its original creator in such a way as to provide a compelling experience without infringing on the intellectual property of the continued X-COM franchise as per its 2012 reboot.\n\nI recommend getting the game and playing it \u2013 as I also recommend getting and playing 2012\u2019s  X-COM and 2016\u2019s X-COM 2 as well. There is great fun to be had on both playing fields.\n\nOn a personal note however I will add that I am sorely disappointed in Mr. Gollop for having dropped Linux support \u2013 which was originally promised. This was later revised to \u2018not at launch time\u2019 due to the strain it put on Snapshot\u2019s small development team \u2013 but would be revisited later. Here we are a year later and no Linux support in sight. Now that Mr. Gollop\u2019s company has been purchased by Embracer Group through it\u2019s Saber Interactive division, it is unlikely to ever happen. Snapshot should have pushed harder for Linux support.\n\tIt was difficult for me to accept the choice of Unity and C# for Phoenix Point\u2019s development, but I could look past it. I mourned the choice to have Phoenix Point be an Epic Game Store exclusive for a year \u2013 but I understood the financial aid it would bring to a small developer. But dropping Linux support altogether \u2013 that I find an unacceptable blemish on all of this. As a long term fan of Mr. Gollop\u2019s work I still decided to purchase and play Phoenix Point \u2013 but not without some bitterness tainting my palate in what should otherwise be a thoroughly enjoyable dish.\n\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n\u2714 enhanced tactical depth (in-mission)\n\u2714 enhanced tactical depth (global overview)\n\u2714 interesting lore\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n\u2717 lacklustre graphics \u2013 comic book style cutscenes\n\u2717 simplistic, repetitive and sometimes flat-out bad voice acting (mission mode)\n\n--- In-Depth Review ---\n\nNote: In-depth review will have to be a little more limited than initially planned due to the length of the \u2018at a glance\u2019 section.\n\n\u2022 Gameplay\n\n[b]Mechanics:[/b]\n\nMechanically the campaign / global elements of Phoenix Point function like a hybridisation of the original 1994 X-COM game and modern iterations of the Civilization franchise. Game-changing choices are put before the player in the form of questionnaires, while base management and map navigation are near-identical to the original X-COM.\n\nIn-mission mechanics draw heavily upon the X-COM franchise reboot \u2013 save the addition of melee combat for any and all characters (i.e. striking with the stock of a rifle) as well as the reinvigorated \u2018free aiming system\u2019 which allows players to shoot anything at any time. Aside from creating a path and tactically selecting which body part to focus on when shooting, it satisfyingly \u2018proves\u2019 to the player that there is no line of sight \u2013 thus no way to make the shot.\n\nCombat depth has further been increased by the very real risk of shooting team mates by accident. Overview is now a specific conical field of vision as opposed to 360 degree \u2018awareness\u2019 - with anything and everything being shot in the view cone. Team mates are sure to be hit by stray bullets if they\u2019re standing between a unit and an enemy in the view cone. \n\nLastly \u2013 ranged stun weapons are back \u2013 which is great.\n\n\u2022 Narrative\n\nThe technological development of humanity has come at a cost far greater than we ever could have imagined. Our development and industry changed the face of the earth \u2013 as we unwittingly opened the proverbial \u2018Pandora\u2019s Box\u2019.\n\tWe worried about rising temperatures and sea levels as the polar and arctic ice was melting away \u2013 never realising what we were releasing onto the world, buried deep within the ice. A virus like no other; insidious and pervasive \u2013 merging with everything in its path, depositing its hateful nature into whatever it can grasp - before releasing it into the wild. Waiting, watching, learning. Adapting, honing and experimenting. It will not come all at once, it has patience. It wants to be thorough \u2013 humanity must end.\n\n\u2022 Atmosphere\n\nCreepy, organic \u2013 almost dirty and infectious if it wasn\u2019t offset by clean industrial design. What remains of humanity is marred by self-righteous platitudes \u2013 the results ultimately no different from that which the enemy is trying to force upon us. As time moves on - it is becoming more difficult to say which is the more infectious, or insidious. \n\n\u2022 Graphics / Visuals\n\nWell put together \u2013 but lacklustre.

They are being invaded. The problem is, the nearest base only got 3 soldiers  (One Marksman, one Assault Man and one level 5 veteran Sniper/Infiltrator) in it and one of the much needed aircrafts is on trading and recruiting mission bringing in new recruit from nearest settlement. I don't know what to do. The timer is ticking and it is vital settlement that have population over 5000. 6 Seat Manticore completes its food run, hastily loaded the ragtag team of 3 snipers and one assault man and threw them at the oncoming settlement invasion. Keep in mind this is midgame and metric shit ton of bases are activated with my soldiers streched thin across the globe, with very few aircraft available. The game is NOT X COM 1 or 2. You actually have pretty much an Ant Pile going on around the globe where you have to do things that involve a lot of logistics, recruiting, and at times using whatever aircraft you have to shuttle soldiers from base to base (either for garrisoning or base defense).\nSo 4 of my schmucks land into the city. New Jericho armored looking soldiers with all their \"Human Supremacy\" training getting slaughtered left and right. One is mind controlled by the Siren, and the bunch of Tyrants with shields running around, killing civilians. All in all typical terror mission BUT... Lo and behold there is 20 feet tall Artillery Monster camping on the other side of the map.\nMy men quickly run into the action. Infiltrator sniper sneaks up to the front and throws decoy of himself, on which two invisible monsters pounce with gusto. Assault man begins his mad Dash (it is an actual skill in the game) with everything he has to get to that living artillery monster. The sniper team of 3 sets up defensive perimeter behind the cars on the parking lot and begins to plink at Siren before it causes anymore mayhem. Siren goes down, but Tyrants and Poachers around her rip the mind controlled soldier, who came to his senses to shreds. RIP.\nPandorans realizing, that while they are busy killing civilians and fighting the few left New Jericho soldiers started to dash for my team of snipers. \nAssault man at that time makes it to Chifon, gets behind the car in front of it and begins to unload his shotgun into its Center Mass.\nMy rookie level 3 assaultman chipping away at gargantuan monster's face and chest with its puny shotgun, pulling out his rifle after emptying entire magazine. All seem to be in vain, even though after several turns he managed to blow through the armor, wound its head and underbelly. \nSnipers while at it being bombrded by the said ABlobtits  with fireworms all over the parking lot. Not only they are desperately trying to save civilians and allied soldiers alike, from being ravaged, now they are being swarmed by homing  FIreworms. Imagine desperate chaos. Here one sniper shoots his sidearm, barely scores the shot on upclose Fireworm, only to turn around and smack another one to death with the pistol's grip. Another sniper while at it, takes headshot, but hits the leg of one rushing Tyrants crabman with the shield, who is running to kill one of the civilians, when suddenly one of invisible Poacher Fishmen appears behind him, and tries to paralyze him with tickles, like some kind of hentai tentacle monster. Sniper rookie  turned around and with the butt of his rifle knocked out Fishman. While that happening the Infiltrator sniper, dropped another decoy at the exit of one of the houses, which was promptly attacked by another invisible fishman. As fishman was tearing at the Hologram, the sniper did Enemy at The Gates the last scene reenactment and blew its head clean off AS IT TURNED AROUND TO FACE HIM.\nMy Assault man is almost out of all his ammo. Desperately I order him to move closer to Chifon and shoot at him point blank range with both its head and body disabled. Chifon nonchalantly turns to my Assault Man and did the most epic Bitch slap I ever seen in my life. At about 15% hp, it hit my soldier so hard, that he broke both his shotgun (the most lethal weapon in my entire 4 man team) and the arm of my soldier.\nSo here is my viliant Assault Man, with broken arm doing the last reenactment of Saving Private Ryan against the Living Artillery/Tank Monster.... EXCEPT HE DOESN'T HAVE A PISTOL! I MY ASSAULT MAN  TAKES OUT HIS HEATH KIT AND INSTEAD OF HEALING HIMSELF HE BEGINS TO BASH THE 20ft MONSTER UPSIDE THE HEAD WITH IT! Yeah, you got that RIGHT. \nThe is literally like watching 2 year old girl, trying to punch repeatedly 6 ft grown ass man to death. \nBUT LO AND BEHOLD.... As my valiant soldier was beating giant monster with his lunchbox, this made great distraction for my Infitrator sniper to run up to thy gargantuan, plant his sniper rifle to its face and finally put down the said monster. Two soldiers just stood there, dazingly looking at it, one is bleeding profusely and with broken arm, unable to raise his last weapon and with 2 shots of ammo left in, and half broken Med Kit that he used to bash giant monster with. Thankfully everyone as the standard was carrying at least one medkit and my infiltrator managed to stop the bleeding.\nWhile this happening, two rookie snipers had their position compromised and in dire looking situation. - Multiple fireworms are converging onto them from all over the map. Civilians and New Jericho soldiers are all dead. And the last of Pandorans are closing into melee range with them. So what does my team do? They scattered like roaches. One sniper using the last of action points he could towards dashed towards my infiltrator and now useless assault man with all the speed he could muster. The infiltrator ran up to roof, what looked like police station tower and hid in panic. Another sniper, got the short end of stick and was set on by the rest of gnawing monsters and ran to the other end of the map, down the street. \nMy infiltrator veteran managed to kill one of Pandoran Tyrants chasing him from behind. Assault Man and infiltrator sniper joined rookie sniper up top, with fireworms unable to climb the ladders, swarming at the bottom of the tower. \nThe rookie sniper who is almost onset by another hulking crabman, runs to the end of the map, turns around and takes aimed shot at the crabman's leg charging at him with its shield raised. It connects and the crabman begins to limp towards him. Alas he still gained onto my rookie soldier and hit him solidly, that almost his entire health bar went down. The rookie's head got dazed, his arm is broken and one of his legs injuried in one hit and about to bleed to death. He panics, Jumps over the car and dashes as far as he could (Luckily) towards the tower literally on the other side of the map. Both of my snipers desperately trying to kill the crabman running after him, set in Overwatch. \nMy bleeding to death rookie runs with all that is left in him towards the tower on the other end of the map. One sniper rookie on the tower is busy killing fireworms at the bottom (Mission objective - Kill all Enemies) with his sidearm, My veteran sniper takes the shot at the crabman and hits its head, dazing it. It begins to bleed, but catches up to my bleeding rookie with all action points used. Bleeding Rookie 10 health points left, turns around, literally felt like said \"This is it\" and took aimed shot with his pistol at the chasing crabman. He shoots, he SCORES. - But to no avail. The crabman is still alive.\nI thought I lost that rookie soldier. \nEnemy round starts. - Pandoran Activity - Crabman stands there for a second in adjustent tile to my rookie sniper with 10 Health ....and collapses. Evil Mr. Crabs bled like stuck pig for his entire run and finally ran out of murder fuel at epic last second (turn).\nMission accomplished with 4 rookies overcoming Giant Artillery Monster, One crazy Siren. About 20 fireworms, about 10 mix of Tyrants, Poachers, and Wretches, but at the cost of entire map destroyed, all settlers and New Jericho soldiers dead.", "timestamp_created": 1607302395, "timestamp_updated": 1607377253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661374986171722412", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81754972": {"recommendationid": "81754972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107112175", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 433, "last_played": 1607264867}, "language": "english", "review": "If you currently do not own XCom2 buy it instead of this game.

Set in the future and your aircraft can't even fly transatlantic?? No timer on flights mean you will miss key events by an hour or more, not having the ability to judge flight times to make the most out of overworld movement.\n\u27a1 The tar monster is broken nonsense with 1% counterplay. Even if you can set the dufus on fire before he spawns, you are left right clicking every enemy you come across to first know if the thing is gonna spawn. And if he does! Invincible spawn, 1st turn steroids and slaps your team to death whilst giving no fux.\n\u27a1 No fatal bleeding means basically just lots of restarting during missions\n\u27a1 The inventory system is the absolute WORST DESIGN I have ever come across. Figuring out the ideal build for each character takes hours and you better open up your excel sheet because that's the only way you will get a proper method of comparing weapons. WHHHHHHHY are there stacks and stacks of ammo in the same page as weapons??? Why can you not sort or filter by type/strength/other?????\n\u27a1 You can't view the abilities of the subclass before you equip it (permanently).\n\u27a1 You can't compare stats of mutated or augmented armour against base armour. Again, get your excel file and track it yourself because clearly the devs don't want their game to make it easy for you to compare item stats.\n\u27a1 The character customisation is so goddamned bad my main team is basically 3 sets of identical twins,\n\u27a1 Action point abilities lack depth. Late game spam of resetting action points by killshot gets a bit tedious.\n\nOne last time, I cannot believe my inventory slot is a forced view of pistols, ARs, and sniper rifles AND ammunition AND grenades.

You can have multiple bases and multiple drop ships.\n\nHowever, I also see why Firaxis streamlined the game. Having two drop ships doesn't add anything other than twice the management. Having to manufacture ammo is another task - that whilst is good for completion, just adds more work. What happens is you have to play many many many similar missions to get a result that would perhaps take 1 or 2 missions in XCOM. This expanded size also makes the balance and difficulty scaling a little off... parts can feel too easy, other parts can feel too hard.\n\nThat said, the geoscape is fantastic and I have really enjoyed the unfolding story.\n\nOverall this game is great - I hope there is a Phoenix Point 2 that doubles down on the good stuff and trims some of the fat. More customisation options for soldiers would be welcome, or at least allowing modders to do their thing... All the extra voices and customisation in XCOM helped make each XCOM solider a real character - and given the fact you have so many in Phoenix point, telling them apart becomes all the more important. \n\nIf you are on the fence and an XCOM fan, I think you will be happy with this game. There is a lot there and some great ideas - just not everything is evenly executed in the final version. \n\nBut this is a Gallop game - and you can see the great ideas and innovations he brings to the genre.\n\nMORE PLEASE.", "timestamp_created": 1607297540, "timestamp_updated": 1607866829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517740726470947266", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81753511": {"recommendationid": "81753511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030827532", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1503, "last_played": 1608486878}, "language": "english", "review": "It scratches that XCOM itch just fine.", "timestamp_created": 1607297094, "timestamp_updated": 1607297094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81751956": {"recommendationid": "81751956", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981638563", "num_games_owned": 3689, "num_reviews": 365, "playtime_forever": 2695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 571, "last_played": 1608039866}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]\"Creative minds are uneven,\n   and the best of fabrics have their dull spots.\"\n[i]~H.P. Lovecraft[/i][/h1]\n\nAh, [b]Phoenix Point[/b]... we finally met. I mean, seriously. This game? It did everything, [i]everything[/i] to prevent me from playing it. First, [b]Snapshot Games[/b] took my money and promised me a [b]Steam[/b] key on release. Then [i]boom![/i] It's an [b]Epic Store[/b] exclusive, no key for you, f*ck you very much, dear customer. But OK, we all know the drill. No [b]Steam[/b]? No money. And with [b]XCOM: Chimera Squad[/b], it's not like we didn't have anything to play in the genre. But finally, [b]Phoenix Point[/b] came out in [b]Steam[/b] a-a-a-and... a lot more \u201cf*ck yous\u201d arrived with it. The first things that I've experienced in [b]Steam[/b] were failed transaction ([b]Steam[/b]'s fault, but still, pretty fun coincidence) and... endless loading screen bug. That's right, the whole year after the initial release, my first experience with the game was endless loading screen. Right at the very beginning. Right after I've pressed \u201cnew game\u201d. Didn't even find a workaround. The only thing that helped me was skipping the tutorial completely, but honestly, what the f*ck?\n\n[i]Anyway[/i], you've got the idea. [b]Phoenix Point[/b] is a game that started with broken promises and continued with bugs and cheap aftertaste. It looks like a cheap [b]XCOM[/b] clone and, well, it feels kinda like that too. And that's the funniest thing here. See, the biggest selling point of [b]Phoenix Point[/b] is the fact that [b]Julian Gollop[/b] was involved in development. You know... [b]Julian Gollop[/b]? A dude who designed and coded [b]Laser Squad[/b] and the original [b]X-COM[/b]? Yeah, that's the man. Naturally, when you read something like \u201c[i]new strategy game from the creator of [b]X-COM[/b][/i]\u201d, you can't help but expect something old school. I mean, we all love what [b]Firaxis Games[/b] did with the series (their first [b]XCOM[/b] pretty much changed the entire genre by making the old formula easily accessible and enjoyable for all kinds of players), but still, when you hear \u201ccreator of [b]X-COM[/b]\u201d, it's hard not to expect... I dunno, more [i]depth[/i]. A new word in the genre. You know?\n\nBut guess what? F*ck you. No, seriously, get the heck outta here with all of your stupid expectations. OK? Thank you. What we have here is a poor man's [b]XCOM[/b]. And I don't mean the original [b]X-COM[/b] in all of its glory. I mean the same exact thing from [b]Firaxis Games[/b] that pretty much everybody copies nowadays. Only with a pretty unpleasant cheap aftertaste this time. On [b]Unity[/b]. Because, like I said, f*ck you. And that's the first thing you should know about this game. Do... not... expect... much. Even though [b]Phoenix Point[/b] doesn't look [i]that[/i] much worse than [b]Firaxis Games[/b]' [b]XCOM[/b], it still does look worse and the fact that, instead of trying to get back to the roots, [b]Snapshot[/b] just shamelessly stole from [b]Firaxis[/b]? It's just [i]ugh![/i] I mean, seriously. This game is a bloody rip-off. No matter how you look at it. All the hard work [b]Firaxis[/b] did to make [b]X-COM[/b] to be fun for current generation of players? [b]Julian Gollop[/b] just took it and said \u201cI was first!\u201d. Also, if you plan to play this game on your big-ass [b]TV[/b]? Well... surprise-surprise! [i]F*ck you![/i] Because, even though technically, this game does support the gamepad, the controls are so bad that you'll want to scream. I'm not kidding, it's so bad that the game is close to be unplayable with gamepad. How did they f*cked up [b]Firaxis[/b]' formula? I dunno. The guys sure have a talent. A talent to f*ck things up that is. So, as long as you don't have one of those tiny keyboards to keep on your knees while playing, monitor and mouse are the only way for you.\n\nThat's a lot of hate, huh? But you know what? Actually, this isn't another one of those \u201cangry\u201d reviews. Because after you'll actually get through all the pain I've mentioned above? You'll begin to see that... [b]Phoenix Point[/b] is actually OK. And even though the story here is just [b]X-COM[/b] all over again (it's really depressing that all of such games follow the same exact story template, [i]all of them![/i]) with no changes whatsoever (well, aside, maybe, from a slight [b]Lovecraftian[/b] aftertaste), the gameplay is almost as addicting as it was in [b]Firaxis Games[/b]' [b]XCOM[/b]. Sure, [b]Phoenix Point[/b] is way less spectacular, but... it has its moments. Most of which were taken from the other [b]X-COM[/b]-inspired games (like [b]UFO: Extraterrestrials[/b] and [b]ALTAR[/b]'s [b]UFO[/b] trilogy), but, well, what's good is good.\n\nLong story short, [b]Yog-Sothoth[/b] or whatever was his name, infected [b]Earth[/b] with coronavirus (I'm not kidding, that's actually the story here) and now three factions should find the way to deal with it. For you it means that you'll be protecting your bases from the infected, destroying the enemy lairs, fighting evil mist (hello, [b]ALTAR[/b]!), making allies and exploring the world. Sector by sector. Which may feel a bit like mobile game, but... it's fun. I dunno, it just is. Especially since you never know what you'll find in the next place. A bunch of loot, allied base, where you can trade or hire troops, an optional quest or ambush. It's just that \u2013 a pretty basic fun. Like I said, your usual [b]X-COM[/b] stuff is all here too (you'll build bases, train troops, capture and research the aliens in the name of science, produce some gear, etc, etc, etc), but this time you'll also be able to produce vehicles and do politics. And even though diplomacy here is really, [i]really[/i] basic (like pretty much everything else), the fact that every action here has consequences and helping one faction instantly infuriates the others? It totally makes things funnier. Especially since you can so-o-o be an a-hole in this game. Receive a gift from your ally and then rob their base and steal their aircraft right away. Because [b]GTA[/b], MOFOs! Seriously, that's some serious gangster paradise we have here. Thug life is strong with this game. Also, I so-o-o enjoyed damage mechanics in this game. I mean, unlike [b]XCOM 2[/b] (which used dice-like mechanics)? Your troops will actually hit stuff! Believe it or not. The biggest problem with gameplay here is that story missions don't feel spectacular, while the regular ones just... well, let's just say there isn't enough variety and the game gets repetitive pretty fast. But all in all, gameplay here is solid and you'll feel fine for at least one playthrough.\n\nIn conclusion, I sure ended up with some mixed feelings here. On the one hand, it's kinda sad that the man who designed and coded both [b]Laser Squad[/b] and [b]X-COM[/b] ended up stealing from people who actually worked hard to give [b]X-COM[/b] the new life. Even more so since [b]Phoenix Point[/b] fails to be nearly as good as [b]Firaxis Games[/b]' [b]XCOM[/b]. But on the other hand, when you accept this game for what it is \u2013 there's actually quite a lot of fun in it. And since the new [b]XCOM[/b] doesn't come out every day... let's just say that, as long as you like the series, you should give this one a chance. Just make sure not to expect much. Otherwise, you may end up being seriously disappointed.

We're on the third resurgence of it now but a group of people named Phoenix Point are here to try and keep humanity going. There's three other factions that are taking part in this with you. One is the fascist megacorp New Jericho, the syndicalist Synedrion and the religious Disciples of Anu.\nNew Jericho want to wipe out the virus and the fishmen, Anu want to live alongside the fishmen and Synedrion are sort of in the middle.\n\nThe entire game is based around the factions and this is where my first issue with it comes in. There's very little vertical progression of tech. The three factions have specific weapon types that are good against specific things and you can make their weapons...and that's kinda where it ends.\nYou can ally with them and get some more horizontal weapon changes that again work on specific types of enemies but actually upgrading isn't a thing.\n\nGameplay loop wise it also feels strange. I'm kinda going around putting out fires but barely making any progress on the story itself. The research feels bitty and doesn't have a lot impact to it either.

There's exploration points, there's the Havens that the factions hang around in and there's Pandorian lairs where you go to fight fishmen.\nThey're samey but it requires a ton of busywork to actually do what you need to do.\n\nThe epitome of the busywork in the game is that when a fight ends you don't fully heal. It's not like Xcom where taking damage means you're injured though - if you heal your guy in the fight, then when you're outside of the fight they stay healed. So the optimal option is to heal before you finish the level every time.\nIt's such a faff.

I played it during Epic Store exclusivity period and it improved a lot since first versions and I foresee that it will get event better with more updates and DLCs.\n\nFor me the best part is the tactical combat with it's free aiming feature. It brings a lot of fun and gives great feel of control over the action. I also enjoy the soldier development system with usefull skills, usefull stats and great combinations which are all viable. There are some super combos still (enabling to kill a lot of enemies with a single soldier in one turn), but it gets better with the updates and the skills get pretty balanced.\n\nI like the atmosphere and enemies and totally recommend to read the short stories on Phoenix Point website, that adds a lot of atmosphere too and you will meet the characters from stories in the game.\n\nThe research is as good as expected and I like that there are often trade offs among the weapons - one is more accurate, second does more damage etc. The factions are fine too.\n\nWhat I think that still needs improvement is enemy evolution - it keeps pace with you, which is good, but I don't observe any changes in tactics or body parts depending on my tactics. But I believe this will be also enhanced with further updates, as every update up to now (v1.9) made the game better. Also the geoscape seems not interactive enough - clearing nest will prevent attacks for some time, failing to defend haven will wipe that haven out, but you have no long time agenda there (you don't slow down the enemies, don't change the situation, etc.), just exploring one point of interest after other. There are several quest lines, which is nice and you have to show some strategic thinking to protect as many havens as you can while doing important missions, that is fine, but it feels a bit isolated.\n\nThe most boring part is the final grind, where you soldiers are powerfull, you are waiting for final research / missions / maxing out the soldiers (it's hard to resist that :-) ) and the game keeps throwing a lots of missions at you sou you spent hours defending havens and clearing out the pandoran structures. But thanks to free aiming system and ramdomly generated maps it is still kind of fun. :-) Plus you never know what enemies you will encounter and major mistake still can kill your maxed out soldier.\n\nOverall I find this game great and I'm really looking forward more contend with upcomming DLCs.", "timestamp_created": 1607268509, "timestamp_updated": 1607268509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81731168": {"recommendationid": "81731168", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979614721", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 619, "last_played": 1607266730}, "language": "english", "review": "TLDR - Got it half price, between thumbs up/down.

I love the suspense of the unknown, technological advancements that turn your early cannon fodder into BA killing machines, and I love sci-fi lore when it comes from a place of fantasy while remaining believable. This game has all of that. What I really like the most is that it has a more old school feel than XCOM 2 while simultaneously implementing some very sweet QoL improvements to the the same feeling combat system, such as return fire, getting rid of the percentage to hit dice rolls, and the new scope perspective is just great. It really pulls you in to a much more immersive understanding of what the aliens are like, face to face.\n\nGraphically I have absolutely nothing bad to say. The Geoscape, tactical maps, character models and special effects really are satisfying to the eyes. Especially if you're running a decent machine, I really think the optimization is spot on for more updated machines. I've yet to encounter a bug or crash.\n\nSound may be my only complaint but it gets the job done. Some of the voice over talent really had me shaking my head. The music is dark and occasionally suspenseful enough to draw your into that zone of concern and excitement. Weapons sound typical for the genre. \n\nThe story, lore, and characters are all very interesting to me, but again, I'm a sucker for that type of thing. I really enjoyed the way lore research is backed up with some very high quality artwork and cut scenes. I don't do spoilers so you'll just have to see for yourself.\n\nLastly, there is just enough customization of your troops to give you meaningful decisions to make regarding their specialization. It's really worth it to plan ahead when making these types of selections and the game doesn't really give you enough information or explanation as to what some of the quirks actually will work like in the field. Live and learn though, most of the quirks are game changing, but never game breaking.\n\nI have not played this game prior to it's release on Steam and I got it at the introduction price,  $30 USD.

Do you like resource management - managing your own base and watching it grows? \n\nIf the answer is yes, then this game is for you. Ignore those XCOM fanboys, I played through both XCOM 1 & 2 and even the original ones released more than 20 years ago, those are different games that target different groups of players, there's no point trying to compare XCOM with Phoenix Point. \n\nJust buy this game while it's still on discount.

Playing the game feels like homework. Read what the notebook says, go to that marker and do it... No sense of accomplishment or urgency... No big story or reward or cinematic events or feeling of some greater purpose or meaning to your actions.\n~Nothing in the game is memorable or has charisma or personality.

Felt like actual survivors somewhere fighting seas monsters, and each one had their own look and style. Combat seemed much more engaging, violent and visceral...

I was an early backer for Phoenix Point, and felt it could be the next great TB tactics game. The potential is still there. But somewhere along the line, what could put PP as a reference in the genre got lost. It was first shown with a body horror, lovecraftian sci-fi setting (in the early days, there was even jokes being made by the community that The Fly's Brundefly could be an enemy in the game, and would mesh really well). But that was dropped for another post-apocalyptic seen so many times sci-fi world. The written lore was amazing and showed a lot of depth, and really, search for Phoenix Point's Briefings to have an idea of what was achieved by the writing team. But such a deeply researched, very well writen lore didn't make a difference in the game. Initial footage showed battles in oil rigs with huge monsters being hinted, but by the final game there were no huge monsters, just your regular troop soldiers. Comparisons with Firaxis X-Com's franchise will always be made, and rightly so, as Phoenix Point's developers didn't shy away from admiting the influence. Which it's just as well, seeing as Firaxis was highly influenced by the original XCom. \n\nIf you played your War Of The Chosen to death, and can't stand to return to defeating those damned Chosen and their endless banter, Phoenix Point is a fine option.

It obviously borrows heavily from the Gollop Brothers' original hit X-Com games, particularly 'Terror from The Deep' and 'Apocalypse', but has also learned several important lessons from the success of the 'XCOM' series reboot. Effectively, it places itself between those two poles, and in doing so, offers something that might appeal to fans of either set of games, and which will DEFINITELY excite anyone who enjoyed both.\n\nFrom the original X-Com games, it not only borrows the themes - Lovecraftian horrors attacking mankind from the unknowable depths of the sea from 'Terror from The Deep' and bio-technological foes/mind-control parasites hatching from creepy, Geiger-esque eggs from 'Apocalypse' - but also the depth and complexity. You have many different resources to juggle, different factions to try and keep happy (another element borrowed from Apocalypse), a granular stat-growth system, and the ability to target individual enemy parts to achieve various effects.\n\nFrom modern XCOM, it takes the more smooth and user-friendly battle-system, a moderation of the 'spreadsheet' approach to stats and information that somewhat marred the classic games, and a lot less time spent watching your elite soldiers run around like headless chickens in a state of abject panic. It still HAPPENS, but not the way it used to in the old games. It also borrows the 'Earth has already mostly fallen to the threat' setting of XCOM2, just for good measure. The real star of the show, though, is something entirely new - the way it handles accuracy. \n\nAnyone familiar with this style of game knows of the sheer absurdity that a simple, percentage-based accuracy-system can cause. Missing an enemy at point-blank range, to the point that your gun is physically inside the enemy model, simply because there's always a 5% chance to miss. Characters unleashing a hail of bullets in some random direction just because the dice-roll determined that they weren't allowed to hit. Some games, like Phantom Doctrine, dismissed the randomness entirely and made it so that every shot was a hit - with stuff like cover merely reducing the impact of the attacks. A completely deterministic system... which of course generates just as many ridiculous situations.\n\nPhoenix Point, meanwhile, introduces a system that's both realistic and fun to use: When you target an enemy, you get a scope with two circles - 50% of your shots will land within the smaller one, while 100% land within the larger. Hence, if you're close enough that the target will occupy the entire scope, every shot will hit - meanwhile, longer shots with intervening objects are less likely to land a lot of hits. If other units are in the way or standing behind the target, they may get hit too. Cover has no magical percentage-reduction ability, it simply reduces the amount of enemy flesh you can fit within your scope. Targeting a particular limb thus becomes a natural thing as well as a trade-off - if your target is at the edge of the creature, more of the shots will likely go wild than if you aimed for a center-of-mass shot. It also helps that most of the attacks you use are 'burst fire', where it isn't so much a matter of hit/no hit, but rather how MANY of your bullets hit.\n\nIt's honestly the best solution I've ever seen to the issue of accuracy-calculations in tactical games like this, and I hope a lot of other developers are taking notes and plotting to blatantly rip it off!\n\nThere's not much else to say, really. It's basically an X-Com game with the serial-number filed off. You build bases (albeit with the new twist that you're 'reactivating' dormant bases and repairing decaying facilities, rather than having to build new ones from scratch), recruit soldiers, gather resources, research new equipment and fallen foes, field automated vehicles alongside your fleshy troops for added support, and occasionally wind up wandering into a no-win situation that sees your whole squad wiped out. At that point, depending on your attitude, it's either time to reload an earlier save and try again from a different angle, or time to suck it up and try to salvage the strategic situation despite the tactical loss.\n\nThough, if you're the 'hardcore ironman' type, do be warned: The game doesn't have any outright 'Ironman' switch implemented at this time, so you'd be running purely on your own discipline - indeed, it actively encourages you to save before attempting risky moves. Conversely, it doesn't AUTOSAVE during tactical combat, so there aren't going to be any automatically-generated fallback-points there tempting you. Also, the game is genuinely hard - soldiers are hard to come by and expensive in terms of resources, and take time to train up to the point where they're genuinely effective. Losing a full team can very easily be a situation you can't recover from, if you haven't been specifically working to maintain a stable of reservists, which is an expensive proposition to say the least.\n\n\nSo, with all that said - are you ready to join the fight against the horrific Pandoravirus-induced aquatic mutations that are surging out of the mist-covered seas to devour mankind?

Such as larger squads, vehicles and multiple bases. My favorite change probably has to be with how aim works. It's no longer an arbitrary percentage based on stats that leads to a point blank miss because of a bad dice roll. Now there are two circles with every shot guaranteed to at least land in the outer circle and a 50% shot for each bullet to land in the inner circle. The size of the circles depends on the weapon. This makes distance and shot angles far more important. Shots are also no longer entirely fail or miss. If a weapon shots 5 shots then you might hit 3 and miss 2. Melee attacks are now also guaranteed to hit.\n\nThe game also features 3 main factions that you will be dealing with. I find these factions to be far more interesting than the 3 factions present in Xcom 2 War Of The Chosen.

The biggest offender is simply knowing if your troops will be able to see the enemy from where ever they move too. I cannot count how many times the UI will draw the line showing that my troop should be able to see an enemy from the new position, only to actually move and try to shoot and not be able to. It's frustrating and unnecessary.\nThe other problem is the bugs. So many bugs. In just 7 hours of gameplay I've had to reload the game ~10 times because it gets stuck on one bug or another. From not starting missions, being unable to control my transport, not being able to select missions, squad members not being able to take any actions, enemies freezing and not taking actions, etc etc. It's really quite annoying and not what you'd expect from a game that has been out for this long.\n\nIf you can only buy 1 tactics game, save your money and go buy X-Com 2.

Especially if you get it while on sale. I will compare it to X-COM 2 as that is what is expected.\n\nComparatively, what makes Phoenix Point different and good is the body part and shooting mechanics, and the world map. Compared to a flat % to hit this is so much nicer. Arguably the best improvement over XCOM. The overworld map is better. Being able to have multiple bases and teams out in the world is good. The story is more engaging. The other factions are interesting and provide replay variations. Exploration is good. Now this is different in XCOM partly due to the story of that game, where you are retaking the world as opposed to repelling encroachment.\n\nThere are also a larger variety of vehicles, aircraft, and weapons. The bad part is that its annoying to have to rebuy ammo and usable items like grenades and medkits. I presume that is how it is as a method to keep you actively in the world gaining resources else you might get smashed when you cannot afford ammo anymore. Still, XCOM doesnt require this and thus that makes that aspect better.\n\nNow for battles... XCOM battles are more tense. 2 reasons. You know it can go south very quickly, and that they are usually time sensitive in some manner. Phoenix Point battles offer no time pressure. The enemy doesnt destroy your supplies, they don't overwhelm you (unless you run out of ammo), and its not X turns to complete objective. That pressure keeps battles more interesting. Phoenix Point offers you unlimited time to complete missions. So it is really a matter of personal preference which one you like. But not feeling that pressure allows the battles to feel repetitive and mundane, even if they are good overall, and they are.\n\nThe enemy models look pretty cool too.", "timestamp_created": 1607196279, "timestamp_updated": 1607196279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503105580806732178", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81678097": {"recommendationid": "81678097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008365093", "num_games_owned": 469, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 332, "last_played": 1607190883}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a more intricate version of xcom.

I'd recommend the game in its current state, and I feel like the general trend of the game improving is a good sign for what's to come. \n\n[b]Full Review:[/b]\n\nI'm a huge X-COM fan, over 1,000 hours played on X2 alone.  I was an early backer for PP, played through the early pre-release builds, and lived through the disappointment of the exclusivity deal.  So the low playtime on Steam doesn't account for any of the actual time I've played on that other platform.\n\nI was not able to complete a play-through in the early days of PP.  The game had too many issues - both bugs & balance issues.\n\nWith the LotA DLC, that all changed.  I've been through 2 full games since then, and the overall experience is in a better place.  I haven't gone through the latest version of the game yet, I'm holding off because Cyberpunk 2077 is right around the corner.  The addition of the new weapons does sound like another step in the right direction.\n\nOn to the elephant in the room - comparison to the X-COM series.\n\nPP is a very different game from X-COM, and if what you're looking for is X3 you're going to be very disappointed.  Not because PP is a bad game, but because it's a very different experience.\n\n[b]Pacing:[/b] the games are paced [i]very[/i] differently, and this is one of those things you might not think matters much but it has a huge impact on how the game feels.  \n\nX2 is fairly linear.  You have guerilla ops popping at regular intervals, you occasionally get a council mission or a supply raid, and then you have the ability to raid facilities and do the story missions as you progress.  In between you just fly around and scan stuff to fill the time.\n\nPP's pacing starts off slow, but it ramps up as the game progresses until endgame where you have things to do popping up constantly across the globe (and you'll need multiple teams to put out the fires, because PP has your soldiers in physically different locations and it actually takes time to get to missions).  It does get to a point where it gets kind of on the frantic side.  There's a lot to keep up with, and the increase in the number of events is likely on purpose - as you get closer to the end of the game it does start to feel like a battle against an unstoppable enemy.\n\n[b]Economy:[/b]\n\nIn X2 you're got cash, elerium, alloys, intel, and cores.  The method by which you collect each of these is pretty similar, with a few exceptions here and there.  Overall you'll hit resource contention occasionally, but often you'll get a way to resolve that fairly quickly and then you're fine.  Really, the only penalty for running out of a type of resource is you don't get to get that next shiny new toy you want, or you can't contact a new map area yet.\n\nIn PP, you have 3 main resources (tech, materials, and food) along with a slew of secondary resources you unlock as the game progresses (3 faction reputations, mutagen, 3 legacy of the ancients resources, and bases and aircraft).  This puts you in a position where resource contention is a constant issue because you don't unlock the ability to have a reliable source of income until mid-game.  Do you buy that new weapon you just unlocked, or do you bring a new base online?  Which aircraft do you want to steal from which faction (because you're going to take a rep hit)?  Do you risk running low on tech/materials and not being able to reload your ammunition after a mission?  Oh, and you don't magically get enough gear for every newbie you recruit - you've got to produce or scavenge it all.\n\nSo while I've found myself making some decisions on resource allocations in X2, I've found it to be way more prevalent and impactful in PP.\n\n[b]Game Progression:[/b] This leads me to the way you progress through each game.  \n\nX2 is a more linear game, where things like base building order is pretty set from the start and I don't tend to deviate much from that order.  Rush mag weapons, unlock squad size upgrades, manage the doomsday clock, profit.\n\nPP does allow for a bit more freedom in how you approach it.  The gear upgrades you get aren't as big a jump, but I'd argue opening the classes from the factions are a much bigger deal.  Granted, you'll probably get everything eventually anyway (just like with X2), but there is a bit more randomness to how the early/mid game will play out.\n\nBoth games have a clock you're running against, and this is one place I find X2 to work better because there's a constant back and forth.  In PP, I haven't found a way to reverse the progress of humanity being wiped out - so if you make a mistake and put yourself behind early you're going to be in for some trouble.  You can slow the progress, but it's a one-way ticket to humanity's extinction with no way back but to finish out the game.  While this does give a sense of urgency to the late game, it removes that tension you get from the back and forth presented in X2.\n\n[b]Gear/Soldier Progression:[/b] this is a pretty big point of contention, but it's because these are very different games.\n\nIn X2, gear jumps are big advancements that feel extremely impactful.  When you open up mag weapons, it's a big milestone.  Same with Warden armor.  And your soldier abilities at certain breakpoints.  You see these jumps in game, and it has a very real impact.\n\nIn PP, until you bring ancient weapons online the gear jumps are much smaller.  I think part of the problem here is that the player doesn't get as much feedback on what these stats do when you're on a mission.  If you increase a soldier's stealth stat, you don't have any way of seeing what that really means.  Aim is much more esoteric than in X2 with the free aim system, so a +10% accuracy bump isn't as noticeable as it is with the \"all or nothing\" way X2 handles hits.\n\nActual soldier progression in PP is more flexible than in X2.  With X2, you have a solder's class you get to assign when they level up from Rookie rank and that determines what skills you get, with a few random skills assigned when the game rolls that soldier.  With PP the first class is assigned when the solder is rolled (so no picking the first class), and each character gets random abilities assigned as well, but you also get to add on a second class midway through a solder's career.  This opens up a ton of options for customization, and I'd also consider the random skills to be much more relevant as there are some that open up entirely new classes of weapons that can allow for far more flexibility in the way you set up the soldier.  Add on to this that you also have the ability to increase 3 stats on each soldier from the same pool of points you buy skills with and there's a lot more going on as far as player choices go.\n\n[b]Closing thoughts:[/b] with this review getting to novella length, let's wrap up.  \n\nWould I recommend the game?  It depends.  Just because you like the X-COM series doesn't automatically mean you'll like PP, and if you don't like the X-COM series it doesn't mean you won't like PP.  They're very similar games on the surface, but with numerous small differences that stack up to make for very different experiences.  PP has come a [i]long[/i] way since the pre-launch builds, and most of those changes have been for the better.  I feel like the game is in a good place right now, I find it enjoyable enough to hold my attention and to provide what I want for a full play-through.  I'm also very encouraged that the devs are continuing to tweak and improve on a lot of things, even though I miss some of the older overpowered combos that have been removed (RIP Rage Burst Snipers).  If you're interested in the game, go in with your eyes open that this is not X-COM 3.

So you can get a good idea of what the game will play and feel like just from that alone. It's not [i]XCOM 3[/i] but it's an excellent tactical TBS game. After spending a year an an Epic exclusive, it's now on Steam with all of the additional DLCs, updates, and more contents in one package. I bought the base game on Epic a year ago and am happy to have the whole game in one package here on Steam now.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nA new virus on Earth started to turn mankind into some of a hybrid alien form, threatening those people last remaining. The Phoenix Project is a secret organization looking to find a solution. Take on the role of their leader in this push to save mankind.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game's tutorial will cover everything you will need to know within the combat sections, this is well done. On the other hand, not everything is explained for things to do in the overworld and that can be improved. If you start the game for the first time, the additional things to do can feel overwhelming until you get used to it.\n\nMost of the time that you spend will be on the battlefield, as that is the main part of the game. The battles are all turn-based. You will control a team and spend your action points per turn. You can take cover in most similar games, finding loot along the way during the missions. You can shoot at enemies when you spot them.\n\nThe great thing about this game is that when firing at an enemy, you can choose between a normal shot and an aimed shot. If you select to do an aimed shot, you will zoom in on the enemy unit and you can choose which part of to try to hit. As usual, you will be able to see a displayed/calculated success rate as well as how much damage that particular action would do.\n\nAfter the battles, you will go to your base, where you can level up, heal, build new things, among other options. And you can go to the overworld map to explore various sites. These will usually contain missions or belong to different factions. These other actions have different goals and values, so you will deal with them through diplomacy, deception, or brute force.\n\nThere are four difficulties to choose from, so you can definitely find one that's most suitable for your own comfort/challenge zones.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThese graphics are fantastic, zoomed out or in, everything look really awesome.\n\n[h1]Music & Sounds[/h1]\nThere's a bit of eeriness feel to the music that fits the game rather well. The sound effects are what you would expect from these games and work fine.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nThe game can be played with a Mouse and Keyboard or you can use a controller. I prefer the M+KB combination.\n\n[h1]Gameplay Video[/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgLy9pCDWCs\n\n[h1]Pricing[/h1]\nThe \u20ac50/$60 base price is what you can expect from this game and is justified. The main campaign will likely take an average player about 30+ hours, and you can expect 60-70+ hours if you want to do all of the side content. The current launch sale on Steam is at 50% off for almost 3 weeks, so I think it's a great deal to grab it during this current sale price. And it includes everything released for this game so far in one neat package.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nIt has become cliche to speak like this, but if you like [i]XCOM[/i] then I am sure you will enjoy [i]Phoenix Point: Year One Edition[/i] as well. I do enjoy the overworld and all of the events more from [i]XCOM[/i] and this game has a heavier focus on the battles. The battles are absolutely solid in terms of what you would want from a tactical turn-based strategy game.\n\nOne thing to note is that when I first installed the game on a regular HDD, it was taking a really long time to load. I did not encounter these loading issues on my SSD. So I would definitely suggest using your SSD if that's an option for you.\n\nIt's a great game, and absolutely recommended from me!\n\n[quote]I received the product for free.

That said, I'm not going to fault the game itself for this. \n\nThe tactical experience in this game is similar if not better than the XCOM series in that there aren't triggers that set waiting aliens in motion as there are in XCOM. Also, at four hours in, I find the types of missions more varied than they are in the XCOM series, without the artificial time constraints. \n\nThe strategic experience offers more variety also than the XCOM series. You have deeper political considerations with warring human factions. This looks like it will offer better replay value than XCOM. Also, the voice acting for the faction leaders is fairly decent, imo.\n\nWhat XCOM does better is the personal touch for your characters. I grew attached to characters that I designed and named after friends. IN Phoenix Point, they seem kind of one-size fits all regardless of customization. That said, PP, like XCOM, has classes of fighters that you can tweak as you level up.\n\nAnother thing I like better in XCOM is the feel of immediacy in combat (through amped music, closeups of aliens, louder sound effects). Combat is still fun in PP, just not quite as tense. Also, the base building is just butt-ugly imo in PP. A small thing, but I did like XCOM's side view with an animated base.\n\nWorth a buy?

This game is not soo good as it could be.\nI like the idea that you have some more freedom to decide what to do compared to xcom. Here you have different spots on a world map which you can explore. The fractions remind me a little bit of GTA2 where you can please one whilst damage another fraction. You have a lot to research and find and many weapons.\n\nThe KI/enemy is good, too. The fights don't become boring. The \"free aim\" to aim for vulnerable spots is a very nice idea. So you can cripple legs and the enemy gets a smaller range to walk. Some enemies have some kind of shields so they don't get damage. Even if your position is bad: You can try to shoot arms or legs to deal some damage.\n\nEven after 10h of gameplay this game doesn't convinced me. The game is okay and i would rate it neutral if possible (not good, not bad). Worst part from my sight is the battle control. In XCOM you have a number for every action you can do.

It's good that you can attack/fire with F and have overwatch on Y but why do i have to click a button for a melee attack? Why do i need to press a button for a dash?\n\nThis game has a great potential if the controlling would be better. The base building is okay but it's hard when you need research facilities instead of people to increase research times (in this game, you have an AI which does your research).\nYou have resource management to recruit new people (and keem them fed) or build buildings/weapons.\n\nFrom my point of view: Give this game a try it's interesting and makes some fun. For me: It didn't catched me like XCOM and the DLCs did. It doesn't feel \"right\". There are some gameplay aspects i can't name but which are giving me the feeling that there is something missing.\n\nEDIT:\nI gave the game several chances to convince me but the missions don't feel like to achieve anything even if you win. Furthermore i ran into multiple bugs recently: I was unable to shoot at enemies. When i move my people i see a line of sight indicator but the enemy keeps greyed out.\nEven if i shoot them with \"free aim\" ability they get no damage.\n\nSo the game feels worse than before and i changed my review to \"not recommended\".\n", "timestamp_created": 1607182955, "timestamp_updated": 1607891132, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473691105842590332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81665386": {"recommendationid": "81665386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048289252", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 8201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 999, "last_played": 1609652447}, "language": "english", "review": "Game was released yesterday and I have 16 hours of gameplay.

However, lack of real-time mode alternative (that was present in X-COM: Apocalypse) gives a tingle of disappointment.\n- [b]Base Building & Management[/b] in the Phoenix Point is complete downgrade compared to depth that was present in X-COM: Apocalypse. I can't get rid of a feeling that Phoenix Point base management was added just so they could add a mark that it was added.\n- [b]Geoscape[/b] of the Phoenix Point... Is pretty much Google Earth modified to navigate your troop transport between POI (Points of Interest) and nothing else. Extreme let down after classic X-COM games (Apocalypse, Terror from the Deep and UFO Defense). Every time I look it, I feel betrayed (beside bait & switch to Epic).\n\n[u]Conclusion, after crushed expectations[/u]:\nIf this game was developed by Firaxis, it would've been acceptable, since they can't jump above their heads. But, for a game, whose development was leaded by Julian Gollop, it has barely passing grade. Especially, after taking one more year of sweet time to develop and polish it even further. Julian, you could've done it so much better.\n\n[u]Disappointment, bleak light after the end[/u]:\nYou see Julian, when I've seen you leading development of Phoenix Point, I've expected it to turn X-Com: Apocalypse^3, just as Stellaris by Paradox became pretty much Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares^3, i.e. true evolution of original genre and style.\n\n[u]Verdict, for good of all of us[/u]:\nIf you're one of two categories of players mentioned in the beginning, you'll enjoy playing it and there is no reason not to buy it ([b]but, only at 50% of the price[/b]). If you belong to third category as me, it will only scratch your itch, then it flare your anger that will cooldown overtime into solid disappointment. Maybe, in 5 (or so) years it will become what we've expected it to become. Right now, for all the veterans of classic X-COM I'd suggest to put off playing Phoenix Point at least until they will release Festering Skies DLC that should make Geoscape somewhat worthy of being called as such.

A world that you are just part of and is not centered around you. Atmospheric, lots of small details. Lovecraftian theme and horrific aliens. Lore and writing is really good. Factions and diplomacy are a little raw but also way above what others offer. Huge replay value. Also its just different in a world full of X-com clones.\n\nDo not listen to haters, most people who write bad reviews still can't get over how bad the game was on Epic release. You can tell b/c most of those reviews are factually wrong. See a lot of mechanics has changed since year ago but they still critisize it for these old mechanics no longer in the game(like that one guy who claimed you can destroy concrete walls with pistol fire). Some just see one aspect they think is bad and bash it (some say classes variety are bad, others \"base building\" is poor) - usually wrong too. For example there are 7 classes in the game and you can mix them in any combination, thats a lot. By mid to end game you will have so many bases, that if each of them had Xcom-like building routine you'd drown in micromanagement. Truth is the game is very different from Xcom. But unfortunately has some similarities that people will use to compare. I think its the biggerst problem here.\n\nRegarding the bugs, as someone who played through entire thing since backer builds till 1.9 there is this thing: devs do try to improve the game. Everytime they do it there are some bugs added, some old bugs resurface etc. This is not bc they didnt fix those bugs. They did. Look at the patchnotes if you dont believe me. But when you upgrade the game all the time, you inevitably have new issues and some of them mimic old issues. They completely changed Alien Evolution system, reworked level generation, changed many mission layouts and objectives, added new missions and enemies, new UI, new weapons, new AI, also integrated a lot of DLC content into the game - all this came with new problems. And almost all of them are fixed for Steam release. Just keep that in mind when reading \"devs did not fix any of the old bugs\" or \"the game is still buggy after another year of testing\" . Yes there can be some unfortunate bugs that are still in, but its not fair to blame devs for lack of trying.\n\nThe game has improved dramatically since last year. Even more so improved during later few months. And I know for a fact it will get even better. Trust me or not, I was one of the harshest critics when it launched on EGS. Everytime I tried another patch I would bash it in Discord server and complain how bad it was. But with little steps Devs did manage to fix most of its problems. And I'm shocked myself to say that, but I can now recommend the game. Even more so I can no longer play Xcom2 which were my top2 favorite game (check my game hours if you dont trust me - Xcom1+2 i have almost 2.5K hrs) because it plays weak after I got a proper taste of Phoenix Point.\n\nI wouldn't pretend the game has no problems. It has some balance holes. Even after nerfs to them you still can create super-soldiers that are terribly OP. You can still get unfortunate squad wipes to some unlucky situations out of you control (rare, but annoying, thought truth is game is built to allow you to handle losses and even squad wipes. Its more like Long War in that regard). There are some exploits you can use to trivialize the game and final mission is still unsatisfying. However most of those issues can be managed and I know it will all be fixed in the later updates.\n\nIf you dont want to get it now, get it later when all DLC are out and its polished even further (With January DLC Festering Skies aerial combat will be joined by diplomacy overhaul). Do not trust bad reviews, they do not do game justice and come mostly from either those still traumatized by Epic Deal or those who are too used to Xcom gameplay and are too quick to judge based on that.

I'm a fan of X-Com/XCOM/WotC/Chimera/etc. I also played many others, like Jagged Alliance series (not #3 :P) and Xenonauts... oh, and UFO:AI (open source X-Com inspired game).\nI love the genre and I've been playing this one on Epic since it came out last December! It has evolved and improved massively. I make a new run every patch / DLC release and it just keeps getting better.\n\nThis has been mentioned in many reviews already but it bears mentioning again:\n--- The way shooting works is the FREAKING BEST IDEA EVER! ---\nNo more misses at point blank. And no more useless cover.\nOf course, that is not perfect still. There's a few moments where that system kinda fucks you over, such as:\n- When trying to shoot around a corner. If you just press \"Shoot\", the soldier will side step before shooting, therefore hitting the enemy. If you insted use \"Free Aim\" (super useful!) around a corner, you often can't actually aim at the enemy since the soldier won't sidestep in free aim!\n- On the note of sidestepping, I wish the soldier went back into cover before the retaliation form the enemy. It feels like that would make more sense...\n\nOther than that, the base building is a bit stale and not that interesting. Also the bases as a whole seem to have very little impact. I think that's a failing of all the modern XCOM-like games though, not just this one. Maybe XCOM2 had a slightly better feel for this with the ship than all others, but overall this part of the gameplay always kinda feels like an afterthought.\n\nAs for the research, the factions, the diplomacy and managing exploring the map it is overall a plesant, mostly balanced experience. Especially the exploration which received a nice update recently (no longer need to manually scan for more locations!). I think that greatly improves the feel of that set of mechanics.\n\nIf you like tactical RPG-ish games, then this is definitely a good game to try. I'd say wait for a special though (like right now! :O ) since I don't think it is worth the full price just yet... it needs more polishing and bug fixed to be worth 100% of that cost.", "timestamp_created": 1607162894, "timestamp_updated": 1607162894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497702896595001221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81647838": {"recommendationid": "81647838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198970933553", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 125, "last_played": 1610253409}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "timestamp_created": 1607162388, "timestamp_updated": 1607162388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472071856260299683", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81646237": {"recommendationid": "81646237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004595556", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 246, "last_played": 1607243571}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr It all comes down to lack of mod support which would add great depth and opportunities to the game.\n\nI really wanted to like this game.\nI bought it on 50% sale but I think 25 greens was still a big price for what it offers.\n\nWhat it offers?\n\nStarting play, they nonchalantly say that they will take your personal data and store them in countries that dont have the same laws for privacy that yours have.

Same with heavy trooper, one of the skills is expertise with assault rifles.\nWow, such variety.\n\nTo get the impression, skill trees are so bland that at level 4 your ONLY choosable skill is Multi classing to a different class!!\nSnipers and Heavies should multi to Assault or Sniper, Assaults to Sniper, never ever multi to Heavy, as per the guides is useless.\n\n\"Noooo problemo\" you will say \"I will just to go workshop and find mods with more skillz and perks-\" HAHAHAHA!!

I only got six hours in before biting the bullet and requesting a refund.\n\nThe Pros\n----------\n~ Removing RNG in favour of Bullet Spread is a fantastic idea\n~ The Vats Like \"Pick Your Shot\" system is very cool!\n~ You can shoot your own men if they are in your line of fire, making for importance of spacing\n~ Crippling Specific Body Parts and Bleedout is fun to play with\n~ The factions all seem pretty cool from where I was at.\n~ The maps look cool\n~ You can shoot then move\n~ It's different enough from XCOM to be its own thing while also retaining core ideas you understand\n\n\nThe Cons\n----------\n~ The game is honestly just insanely easy. The fights are always super manageable and rarely did I ever have any of those \"oh shit\" moments XCOM gave me.\n~ Their introduction of new content is poorly designed and leads to unfair moments. In XCOM when a new enemy is introduced you are at least told it is new or it has a distinct enough style for the viewer to understand \"I am about to fight something with different abilities\" in Phoenix Point it just catches you off guard. Surprise! These enemies fire back when you shoot them! Surprise! These guys can shoot 4 times in a row despite looking similar to another enemy that can only fire twice. \n~ Research is very vague. While it does sometimes tell you the benefits you get, I ended up missing out on super integral research because I wasn't told its value until a bit too late\n~ The sight lines of where you can shoot and where you can't feel very wonky. I can't shoot down at someone directly below me, but if I move one tile to the left I can! Even with the site indicators I sometimes move a soldier to set them up in good sightlines only to discover it wasn't a good area\n~ The vehicles just sometimes break. This is what caused me to quit. I did another pastey mission but was gonna get a vehicle out of it. Eventually for no reason the damn thing locked up and I had to restart\n~ The maps are way too big for the number of enemies. It's like double the size of XCOM maps with a 1/4 of the enemy\n~ The abilities the soldiers get feel very weak or impractical. They get a lot of options but very few feel that strong or are worth using when you could just...shoot the enemy.\n~ The customization for soldiers is bad. Like even worse than Enemy Unknown and that's saying something.\n\nHonestly after all this I only have one thing to say. You absolutely should buy XCOM Chimera Squad. While not a full XCOM game it toys around with some new mechanics while retaining the XCOM goodness. It's short cheap and better than this. I'm probably gonna go back to Enemy Within or another round of Chimera Squad, because while I wanted something to fill that itch. Phoenix Point definitely is not the answer. After a long wait and a year trapped in Epic Exclusivity I sadly cannot recommend this game and I really hope that Steam will accept my refund.\n\nEDIT: Refund got declined.

And they honored their word to give backers an additional key on the platform of their choice, so here I am. Now on to the actual review.\n\nSeen people comparing this to Xcom 2, which is of course fair in one regard as it is from the guys that made the originals, and not the most fair in another. For one thing they are on different engines, which means an entirely different feel. And for another one of the major differences is that Xcom 2 was directly following Xcom: Enemy Unknown (yes i know, duh, but there is a point here) and as such had a fairly set goal they were going for, where as Phoenix Point is going for their own thing.\n\nFor example, the free aim system, and the real bullet trajectory, is a much better option than the 99% misses that xcom EU and 2 are famous for. Another major difference is while it does have a \"doom clock\" type system as Xcom 2 does, the real threat is the game has a system for the \"Aliens\" adapting to your combat style. So in Xcom 2, once you saw an enemy type you knew pretty much all you need to to fight it for the rest of the game; here, if you get too comfortable with easy headshots with free aim, they will mutate to get more armor on their head to make that less effective, or will be more resistant to explosions if you are very grenade happy, etc. \n\nFor those of us that played Xcom 2: WotC, there was alot of talk of how the various factions didnt get along and were ready to attack each other as much as the Aliens, and then it was just resolved in like 2 and half missions and nothing really was different than 3 new unit types; this game has its three factions actually have agendas that conflict with each other, up to the point of the factions even going to war with each other over those agendas. Not to harp too much on the disappointing factions of WotC, but remember how, while cool and worked in the new system, the only real reward for improving relations with the factions was new cards, or sometimes another of their unique class unit, and otherwise you could just ignore them and not really impact the game much? Phoenix has different tech trees that are unique to each faction, and you can only get them by earning favor with that faction by doing quests for them, siding with that faction against the others, or by attempting to steal the tech at the cost of upsetting that faction.\n\nTo finish comparing them, even though at the start i said it wasnt entirely fair but it is the best reference point, the tactical and strategic elements. For one thing instead of unlimited flight via the Avenger In Xcom 2, the manticore ships have set amounts of fuel per movement and have to able to link paths to be able to move to a location. Another difference is that, as opposed to Xcom 2 where you just sit waiting for something to happen that you go to, Phoenix requires you to actually preform scans of your area to find events and looting areas. Yet another serious difference is that in Xcom 2, the tactical was the heavy focus as the strategic just resulted in modifiers for the missions; Phoenix is a little more strategic minded. Yes it is still choices and popups on the global map that then influence what you can do in the tactical battles, but it is more than just \"this enemy type now has armor\" or \"this mission is now available 3 turns earlier than previously\". In this case it is down to choosing between helping this enclave to get favor for this faction which leads to new tech to increase your effectiveness attacking this Pandora base, or doing this time sensitive event over here for different faction thus angering the one faction but receiving a direct reward from the other that then can help you deal with this other Pandora base over here that has been causing issues for this third enclave that you are using for resources and recruitment. It is alot more dense and confusing that Xcom 2's method, which works well for how that game is structured, but overall pays off more, in my opinion, cause you are invested in each micro detail as opposed to just telling your troops which alien to shoot first to get resources for which ever tech you selected first this time around; which in turn adds to replayability more than the set events that are pulled from a fairly static pool.\n\nOverall, I feel this game is at least as good as Xcom 2, and WotC expansion, if not better in several/most regards; and well worth the purchase.\nFor a more numerical label. Xcom 2 WotC is 7.7-8.9/10 for this type of game and Phoenix Point is at least the same if not a 8-9 /10", "timestamp_created": 1607143284, "timestamp_updated": 1607197107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47940477728843689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81634319": {"recommendationid": "81634319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198805584466", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 323, "last_played": 1607395649}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: It feels like Xcom and is pretty fun\nCons: It's not as fun or polished as Xcom", "timestamp_created": 1607141979, "timestamp_updated": 1607141979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505395710468292236", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81633800": {"recommendationid": "81633800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098414839", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 301, "last_played": 1607572375}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the idea of this game, but I already have some concerns regarding simple things that become big problems.

I followed it for a while and then abandoned it like lots of people when they announced the move to Epic. I have totally forgot about it since then and its release just kind of crept up on me as I was playing Empire of Sin. I saw the heavy discounted price tag along with all the advertised DLC/fixes/improvements that developer claimed over the year and decided to take a shot. I am glad I did.\n\nHonestly, I wouldve been happy with just another Xcom clone with a different story and some fresh mechanics to keep me interested. I did not expect to find the combat not just different, but also superior and much more tactical in many ways. At this point I am not that far into the campaign of my first playthrough, and here are my favorite things so far about the game:\n\n- Inventory system with weight and item trading between soldiers. You can find containers on levels that have gear, resources, etc. You loot them for gear that you can distribute among your characters and even trade among them. All items you take into battle can be traded during the combat missions among teammates.\n- Default shoot VS Free Aim choosing when attacks. Thats right, you can actually just attack targets the normal by clickin on em and pressing a button, or you can aim your shoots with a mouse as you would in an FPS. There is a whole mechanic behind it based on distance/accuracy/cover/etc. and it really stands out as something unique for this type of genre.\n- Ability to Melee with your rifle by just smacking an alien bitch upside the head with it. This is a cool \"realistic\" addition that I quite enjoy.\n- Ammo that actually runs out. Having to decide how much extra to carry with you on missions over other items. If you want to reload, you gotta have an extra clip in your inventory/backpack. This adds realism and strategy.\n- Accessories for your armor. When customizing soliders you can add special items to the armor based on the armor pieces they wearin. \n- Enemies body parts as targets provide an entirely new tactical layer when shooting beyond the simple \"shoot leg to immobilize\". There is a whole deep layer to this that Im not going to fully describe as it would be too long, but it really changes the game when your shots hit different body parts and cause varying effects to the enemies based on that.\n- Willpower as a resource for your soldiers in combat. It acts sort of like an energy for skills, but also causes soldiers to \"panic\" when it runs out. You gots to balance it and there are several factors during combat that both add or subtract to it over the course of battle. An extra layer of tactics to consider.\n- Customizable stats in soldier editing screen. Unlike in Xcom, you can also directly edit your soldiers stats (strength, speed, willpower) on top of choosing their abilities as they level up. The experience pool is shared among stats/skills, so you gotta decide which to boost and its another thing to consider.\n- You get a vehicle you can bring into combat similar to what Wasteland 3 offers if youve played that. \n- Combat plays out very differently in terms of movement/stealth and action points. You dont activate pods like in Xcom, and your dude will actually stop moving if youre running and happen to run into an enemy you didnt see before. You can then either shoot em or decide whatever else you wanna do. This is much more realistic than Xcom way where your dude will spot the pack of 5 aliens and continue running right up to them because thats where you had initially clicked at. \n- So far I dont see hard Turn Limits in the battles, but it has a soft cap in the way of \"stamina\" for your soldiers. The more turns you take to end the battle, the more stamina you spend and the more rest your soldiers will need. They will have AP penalties if not well rested, but you can still take them to battle even if you did a long ass one right before. \n- Shot hit % is calculated VERY differently from Xcom. First, you dont actually see neither a % nor a set amount of damage you can do if you roll \"hit\" on your shot. Each weapon actually fires multiple \"shots\" and each has a chance to hit. That % isn't shown, but estimates are indicated based on armor and damage potential. This is one of the biggest changes to the game from Xcom and developer describes it as a way to instill \"simulation\" into the game. I can see where theyre going with this and this new ballistics style really changes up how you play the game and so far I like it.\n\nThese are just some of the biggest ways that this game differs from Xcom in what I have noticed playing thus far. So far, I welcome these changes as they seem to instill a deeper sense of tactics, realism, and simulation into the combat. I have not spent much in the actual map layer yet so I cannot comment on that, but I am really enjoying what Im seeing so far. I have not run into any bugs at all yet after playing about 10 missions. \n\nIt appears to me that a lot of the Negative reviews about this game are customers angry at the developer either for delaying Steam release for Epic store, or for their supposed \"privacy\" violations in the tos or data collections? When you load up the game, it does ask you to let it \"collect anonymous data\" from you based on system specs, etc. HOWEVER, it clearly gives you an option to Opt Out by simply ticking off the check box. I dont know much else about what went on this past year as I told you I stopped paying attention to the game once it went to Epic. \n\nIf you can look past the actual past of this game and the transgressions of this developer, then I highly recommend this game to anybody whos a fan of Xcom or tactical turn based games. Whether you love Xcom and simply want an alternative to play or feel that Xcom is too \"simple\" and want a deeper game with more simulating combat tactics, then give this game a chance. For the current discounted price and the included DLC, you really cant go wrong. \n\nIts clear that whatever state this game was at release that caused so many complaints is now behind it. It plays and runs well without any glitches after over 6 hours of playing and I am having a blast. There is also additional DLC on the horizon and this game is still being developed, balanced, and updated with new content. This gives me something to look forward to as I learn the ins and outs.\n\n It feels all too familiar for Xcom vets, but it has more than enough newly implemented changes to keep you engaged, interested, and thinking about your next move. I wouldnt be surprised to see many of this games mechanics make it into Xcom 3 whenever that is released. Until then, Ill be playing this and prolly some Xcom 2 as well once I do a couple of playthroughs here and master the final difficulty.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1607138883, "timestamp_updated": 1607138883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491040170192718506", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81631369": {"recommendationid": "81631369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023228855", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 711, "last_played": 1617515660}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun, much better than XCOM in some ways but not in others. \n\nI like: Ammo mechanics, bullet mechanics, overwatch cone adjustment, action point mechanics, geoscape size.

For that alone it merits a thumbs up, because it is a competent and enjoyable game in its own right.\n\nThe disappointment is that in the current state it never quite meets its early promise (e.g. the allegedly adaptive enemies don't feel like they adapt, but just level up), and it fails to really give much core novelty on an old format.

Still, you just know straight from the first missions that the combat won't be fun, and you won't care to play it (after similar time-waste with Gears: Tactics). XCOM would interest you from the very first tutorial mission, same with XCOM2... and here? You just see that everything you encounter in the game feels like a low-budget, unfinished work. Also, it was a whole year on Epic, as an exclusive. From what I read, the problems with it are the same as they were at the beginning. \n\nSo save yourself some cash and don't buy it or wait for a huuuuuge discount, like -80%. \n\n[b]But, to be honest... it's just a waste of time. You won't get it back and can spend it on hundreds of other, better games.

I am now very confident that I would not recommend this game to anyone, XCOM fan or not. The things that made me dislike the game:\n\n- The tech tree\n    The tech tree is genuinely the worst I've ever experienced. In Phoenix Point you research things over time, but guess what? Most of these are literally meaningless and don't unlock anything. Probably 60% of them is just \"get resources for researching this\". Supposedly you have to ally/help the factions to get \"interesting tech\" (which is shitty design by the way), but regardless anything you unlock is LITERALLY meaningless and mostly a question of preference, here's an example of some weapons / types:\n- A rifle that shreds more armor, a rifle that shoots longer (not a sniper), and a rifle  that pierces armor. That's literally it. That's all the difference I've had as of my playtime right now. Sure, the base stats are MINIMALLY better (we're talking range tradeoff for slight damage increase / piercing weapons (weapons??? why not ammo??????) which ignores armor but does less damage in the long run...\nMost of the tech is like this: minimal enhancement / just different \"balance.\"\n\nAnd guess what makes all of this completely meaningless?\nThe fact that as soon as I researched something, the enemy got the exact same upgrade. Multiple times. Acid / armor melting weapons? Oh, now your enemy has it too. Yay. Not even a single mission played without them having the exact same weapons / tech. I don't see why you put in a progressive research system if you're NEVER going to get an advantage tech-wise. It's literally idiotic.\n\n- The firing system\nAnd god oh god the aiming system is the worst I've ever experienced. It's LITERALLY worse than ANYTHING in XCOM. For reference, you've got 2 circles, an inner-circle and outer-circle.  Supposedly 50% hit in the inner circle, 50% in the outer. Yep. That's all the reference you have for whether you're going to hit a shot or not. Mind you, if you're unlucky but have to take a gamble, that 50% could all end up in your teammate's head. Very fun and engaging gameplay.\nYou can also just \"shoot\" instead of 'manually aiming.' But yeah. The only reference for whether or not that hits is a HUE OF COLOR on the enemy's health bar. That sometimes just doesn't update or show. Nice. I'd rather miss a 97% hit chance than this \"realistic bullet-bullshit.\"\n\n- The factions\nA couple of factions are in the game. I think around 4. They all HATE each other. Cus they have different ideals. So they HATE each other. Yep. No compromise. Probably. You need to fuck some of them over to win the game. Probably? I lost. Cus I didn't wanna play unethically. So yeah that was fun. But regardless why help them if the tech you gain is virtually meaningless (see above). I dunno.\n\n- The squad system and recruitment\nSo you can have multiple squads in this with multiple vehicles and stuff, so you can go on several missions at the same time -- I didn't do this because I never got the money to make a vehicle -- I could've stolen one from a faction, but I didn't want to. Regardless, the recruiting is horrible -- once you research (I don't know why you need to research the ability to hire people? Feels like they want to make EVERYTHING research) -- you get new recruits you can hire every ~3 days (you can also hire from factions but it's expensive), but often I experienced them being 3x heavy classes or 3x snipers (AKA no point in hiring them). Personally I don't like the whole \"be everywhere at once with 7 squads of soldiers\" because...\n\n... *drumroll* ...\n\nThe missions are goddamn boring.\n\n- Missions and enemies!\nThe missions are terrible! Not only that, the maps are mostly (I don't know if they're auto-generated or not) terrible because you'll rarely have decent cover and the cover system often doesn't even work! Terrible angles on every map combined with cover that seemingly doesn't exist (AKA high walls that just don't have cover, but clearly SHOULD have) makes for a great and fun time. \n\nThe missions just aren't fun with the enemies. They're often just bullet sponges en masse, and most missions have infinite reinforcement so you can't even take your time to play the game. Nope, enemies just keep coming. \n\nThe enemies also JUST might be invisible unless you get SUPER close because clearly they're all stealthy invisible ninjas! Some of the aliens even spit out mist that hide them so you can't kill them at all! And if you enter this mist your guys start panicking and fleeing, killing them all!\n\nI lost my entire lvl 6 squad (max level is 7/8?) to 8 invisible enemies that could shoot 4 shots with their weapons every turn! I couldn't move because they also had Overwatch on me so I had no choice but to die. And so I did. Sure, there might be tech at some point that helps against this, but I sure didn't discover it in my entire playtime.\n\nMost of the enemies are also just bullet sponges. Shoot them with your default attack probably around 10 times each to kill them. And that's just your average goon. Or nuke them with your heavy (but that's expensive!). Who's probably just gonna get mindcontrolled and run next to the \"apex predator\" (no spoilers here!) and get run over. And die. Permanently. No reviving or stabilizing by the way! \n\nSome times you'll also just come across literal boss monsters in the field. It's okay if it was balanced and there were less OP monsters too, but nah... You'll have the 3000 health boss running around killing all civilians while you're being ganked by 3 enemies who've all done mindcontrol on 3 of your squaddies. And next turn they'll get another, cus there's no limit on the mindcontrol! They can control as many as they want. Very balanced. \n\nDid I mention your squad's abilities? No?\n\n- Squad abilities\nIt's all based on your character's willpower! In other words, use it too much and your character flees and dies! Way to decentivize using abilities. And they're all lame too. They're literally all copies of the previous XCOM games, without the cool ones. \n\n[SPOILERS] \n\nWe're talking about abilities such as dash, \"not having to use action points to reload / use inventory\" (more about the inventory below!), making your weapon use 1 less AP (so you can effectively shoot 4 times in 1 round, at the cost of 3 x 4 willpower = 12 WP (max WP is 20 at highest level). Mind you though this is basically not even enough to halve an enemy's health in the end game. Cus they're just bullet sponges. \n\n[SPOILER END]\n\n- The inventory and crafting system\nSo they decided that you shouldn't have infinite ammo in the game. So you have to make your own ammo. But guess what? This ammo can cost a fortune just to make! And after every mission, you'll have to restock it! Yep, once created, it's a consumable that effectively disappears, rendering any profit from the mission you got null. Most missions you don't even get anything from. So you just waste resources doing them. For nothing. Fun. And don't even think about using grenades! Those take DAYS! to make a single of, God forbid you try to do anything different than default attack.\n\nI kinda had to rant. This game just isn't fun. They did so much to make it \"realistic\" that it just isn't fun. It's actually obnoxious. I wasted so much time, hoping I would actually get somewhere cool in the game, but yeah, that didn't happen.\n\nThe difficulty curve just feels like they tried their hardest to give the enemies as many special abilities as possible, making it so idiotically unfair. Enemy snipers that can spit venom and regenerate health every round but also turn invisible if you shoot them just ISN'T FUN.\n\n-- TLDR --\n\nIn summary, it really feels like this game was made by people who clearly misunderstood what made the XCOM games fun. It sucks and isn't any fun at all in the long run. Don't bother. They made everything a chore instead of actually fun.", "timestamp_created": 1607114255, "timestamp_updated": 1607213929, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541284441947937012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81613821": {"recommendationid": "81613821", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994259709", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 344, "last_played": 1607418047}, "language": "english", "review": "Played the game  since launch (1 year ago), and it has come a long way.\nPros\n+ variety of missions\n+ good tension level\n+ enemies adapt to play-style (really cool feature)\n+ enemies variety (\"bosses\")\n+ destructible environment\n+ soundtrack /atmosphere / graphics\n\nCons\n- the tutorial might be a bit short / incomplete for newcomers (but there is nothing you can't learn just by playing the game)\n\nRecommended!", "timestamp_created": 1607113539, "timestamp_updated": 1607113539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51665961742401123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81613064": {"recommendationid": "81613064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030155896", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 3741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 466, "last_played": 1607710764}, "language": "english", "review": "A decent game that differentiates itself from xcom. It definitely takes getting used to since my soldiers for some reason can't lean over railing and shoot at enemies at a lower level. Taking cover at corners is weird as well. In Xcom my soldiers can step out and fire. Here, they transition to free shoot and I am staring at a wall. For any new players it is also useful to run up to an enemy shoot them and then run into high cover. I was so used to xcom ending turns after 2 actions that I did not think of it since this game uses a different action system.\n\nThe most noticeable change is to how guns work. Each bullet has its own trajectory and damage which is interesting. Now you can target specific body parts of an enemy and each part has different armor so where you hit someone matters. This falls short because each weapon seems to have infinite range and the pistol somehow hits across the map. They should patch this by giving everything an effective range since gravity pulls on everything the same. They should also make mission important pathways or objectives indestructible. Having to restart because a single stray bullet or grenade spam destroyed the only way up can be frustrating.\n\nSo far the factions are interesting but they don't really do much for me and could use some work. They are also pretty counter intuitive, for some reason when they go to war they destroy each other's havens. I would understand the disciples of anu doing that, but they should actually occupy and trade havens when at war. It is also not possible to create peace between them all because the game intentionally sabotages the relationship between them as tech progresses.\n\nThe game is too micromanage-eee for my tastes. The cost for equipment to trooper ratio is so high. I struggle to afford even the most basic armor for my soldiers because i am always low on one of the two available game resources. The DLC with the ancients exacerbates this problem to the extreme. Now I have to find SEVERAL NEW resources and mine them. It becomes ridiculous because you have to fly a \"manned ship\" to get the resources. Apparently drones can't do that but they can scout the areas to find more mines. Oh, and you have to do that while having to defend them with your already thin ranks. On top of that to ensure you have resources you have to steal, defend havens, complete missions, and explore. Guess what that needs? You guessed it, another ship full of soldiers. This does not even include destroying pandoran nests. Then we add to the resources issue by having to buy ammo after every mission. Depending on the type of ammo it can be substantial. I have no idea why each resource has a + or - counter when you are incapable of producing your own resources. It's possible to get enough resources but it's a huge hassle that I don't want to deal with.\n\nThe game requires multiple bases in multiple spots that all need multiple expensive upgrades for them to be remotely useful. Not to mention needing to activate each base to add to the resources issues.  it becomes a nightmare with everything else going on. Even then, the enemy can invade and destroy said bases so choose wisely. The ships need to be faster as well since late game none of my ships can make it to a haven before it explodes, especially when I am using a Disciple ship.\n\nI enjoyed the game at first. But nearing the end it feels like a slog because I am constantly having to fly ships to raid or fly ships to trade. Fly ships to defend, Fly ships to attack. Fly, Fly , Fly. That is literally the globescape. Xcom did a great job simplifying this by combining all resources into just one or two. Along with having resources automatically go into your account without extra effort. Aside from that I expected more since I was a backer on fig way back when. I also suggest reading the terms and services since this game has faced criticisms for broken promises along with going one year epic store exclusive. The game is not bad, but it is not good either. Hopefully Julian takes parts of the games that work and pitches it for xcom 3.

It was all very cute, there was nothing about that game that was even remotely scary the way the old ones were.\n\nWorst of all though, the systems were just kinda dumb. It was a game obsessed with right angles, that rolled a dice whenever you took a shot, and that dice only had two faces - hit or miss - for an exact amount of damage, even though you could clearly see your soldiers sending out waves of bullets. The game would tell you you missed your 95% chance, even as it showed you the bullets clearly impacting the alien that you wanted to hit.\n\nNo such tomfoolery here, Phoenix Point is a smarter, more elaborate beast. More simulation and less kids cartoons.\n\nThe shooting is smarter, the cover system is smarter, the overwatch is smarter. At the fundamental level it's a better game because it hands you a greater level of control and trusts you to figure it out, instead of cutting corners and making everything strictly rules-based like XCOM did. XCOM was a boardgame, Phoenix Point is a wargame, just like its grandpappy.\n\nIt does come with a few caveats though. The writing and voice direction are abysmal, and that's sad because the artstyle is really good, and the factions are delightfully campy, so you really want to immerse yourself in the world. Sadly the cutscenes are just cringy and brutal to watch.\n\nAlso the maps are never quite big enough, so it always feels like you\u2019re fighting in a diorama instead of exploring an unknown location. You don\u2019t get the tension that comes with discovery, clearing a dark farmhouse, or dreading whatever is crouched behind the next hedge. XCOM failed to recreate that too, and I don't understand why neither game seems to care. \n\nWhen people talk about X-Com, the second thing they'll mention after the countless hours they spent playing it, is the terror. The stuff you remember is night missions where slimy little sectoids would amuse themselves by picking off your poor night blind recruits. Still to this day, no one has made a game to emulate that experience, and in a world where game developers boast of permadeath features and use Dark Souls as a verb, that's extremely ponderous.\n\nI feel like Snapshot should've pushed a lot harder on the worldbuilding, the tension and the horror, but as imperfect as it is, Phoenix Point is still awfully clever about a lot of things that matter, and it's easily the closest we've come to a genuine X-Com ancestor.", "timestamp_created": 1607111783, "timestamp_updated": 1607111853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476377934217453003", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81612095": {"recommendationid": "81612095", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964084562", "num_games_owned": 491, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 9159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1613899637}, "language": "english", "review": "This game deserves better reviews in my opinion. I have played it on Epic for over a year now, trying it here and there after each update, and now with the year one release I think it's in a really good place and I am excited to see how it develops going forwards.\n\nMost of the negative reviews here will compare this to XCom 2 or complain about Epic Games or some random tech issue. I understand that the epic games deal, and if you have tech issues starting the game, that you might be frustrated and leave a negative review. That said, the vast majority of players reading these reviews likely are curious about the game itself. Let me tell you that, as a fan of the original UFO Defense, this is a huge step forwards from XCOM 2.\n\nWhy do I prefer it over the latest entry in the XCOM series? Mainly for three reasons.\n1- No more bullcrap pod system for enemies.\n2- A real action point system\n3- A combat system that isn't just a dice roll.\n\n1- The pod system in the modern XCOMs completely changes the way you play once you get used to the game. You inch forward with your first soldier to draw out a pod of enemies then proceed to fight with the rest of your soldier. If you move forwards to far with your last character, you are screwed on your next turn. This is unrealistic and boring.\n\nIn phoenix point, the aliens are not acting in pods waiting to be \"woken up\" but they actually explore and move on their turns and also will move on their own. Xcom 2 tried to address this but failed in my opinion. \n\n2- Action points are back! Instead of having two big actions like in the modern XCOM games they went back to the original where you have full control over your characters. If you have enough AP you can move, shoot, and then fall back. You can loot off the ground, shoot, and then hide... You have options and moving one square to far into your \"2nd action\" doesn't completely end your turn for that character. It gives you freedom to make tactical decisions just like in the original xcom.\n\n3- The combat system is honestly the best I've seen in any game like this. It's a big meme that LOL YOU MISSED A 95% SHOT in the new XCOM but it's a meme because it feels like bullshit. Why? Because it is. Your trained soldiers should not miss a point blank shot. It is unrealistic. In this game you have a cone of where your bullets can spread and your shots fall within those cones predictably. This means cover doesn't just effect the dice roll, but it actually acts as cover. If you have a light pole between you and an alien, you might hit that light pole! Even if they aren't ducking right behind it. It's completely realistic and so refreshing compared to the RNG of the modern XCOM games.\n\n\nThis game isn't perfect. In fact, I think XCOM2 has much better mission variety and production values. That said, even with those things I just don't want to play it anymore because I feel like I've figured out the puzzle. I know to creep forward and then wake a pod up and shoot. I know when to take cover and how to bait enemies out to improve my dice rolls. The tactical game in Phoenix Point is much more interesting and dynamic.\n\nThis game is like Xenonauts with a better budget. Julian Gollop really recognized what made his original game special over the modern franchise. I am thankful for it. I hope that Snapshot continues to work on it though because, while it's wonderful to play, it sure could use some more personality, something UFO Defense and the new xcom games are dripping with.\n\nPros:\n-Combat system is more fair and more exciting than any other tactical game IMO.\n-Action points give you more freedom than in the modern XCOM games.\n-No pod system! Enemies move and behave in more realistic ways.\n-Geoscape is easy to understand and there are some neat mechanics with factions.\n-Enemies evolve! They'll try to counter your tactics by changing as the game goes on.\n-I'm a sucker for the aquatic theme of the monsters. Makes me want to go play terror from the deep again!\n\nCons:\n-Lacking mission variety compared to XCOM2.\n-Lacking personality. This is probably my biggest gripe. The voice acting, customization, and even environments are pretty dull. You'll want to play this game for the gameplay, not for the personality or graphics. Hopefully that changes one day. Especially with the underwater theme of the creatures... It could have been so much more interesting looking.\n\nEDIT:\nI'll add one more con to the game. The ending mission is weak and requires a ton of AOE. Almost out of character from the rest of the game. I love the lovecraftian boss but it's a slog to get there and more of a chore than a fun mission. I can see it ruining an ironman run quickly and I hope it's addressed later.\n\nThat said, still the best xcomish game out there and I'm replaying it now after 120 hours. I spent my 120 hours split between two runs, one which I gave up on. I used all the DLC and enjoyed all the lore and missions. Some complain about the frequency of the missions. I agree some of them aren't worth much but honestly, I like having tactical puzzles to just run my guys through. I play it for fun not to rush the ending.\n\nLove the game.

The dynamic creature designs are the real star of the show in my opinion, though I wish there were more base types.\n\nThe Epic deal was a disappointment, but while I dislike Epic and refuse to buy things via their store, only an idiot would turn down money in excess of the total projected sales of the game for one year of exclusivity.\n\nThe issues being faced by backers of the game at the moment seem pretty awful, though I can't comment, as I'm not involved in the situation myself. If I understand the situation correctly, it reflects poorly on Snapshot Games.\n\nThe Terms of Service/Privacy Policy/Etc thing is probably a non-issue, though I'm not an expert. The only reason people aren't upset by the ToS for most games, is because they only read the ToS when they're looking for something to complain about. That shit doesn't hold up in court anyways, and if they tried to do something like remove someone's access to the game for a negative review, they would run afoul of numerous consumer protection laws.\n\nListen to meaningful criticism and complaints from people who've been genuinely wronged, ignore fear-mongering.

They threw around the recognizable names in the marketing quite a bit so I see no sense in not doing the same here. But all I got from the game is that they're testing some ideas, to be pitched for another project.\n\nOverall it's one of those cases where I wished for the neutral recommend button. I definitely don't recommend it for a full price but at a sale you at least won't miss the amount of money you just flushed down the tubes.\n\nThe first gut punch actually comes before the game starts. For the first time ever, I read through a license agreement and there is some juicy shit in there. I don't want to go into the exclusivity scandal here - you can do your own research. But the terms and conditions reminded me of it. Not only do they sell player data to anyone who's interested (which is fairly normalized at this point) but they also keep the data as part of future company merger deals which struck me as new. Also, you're forfeiting your right to pursue legal means against the developers for anything. In turn, they more or less painted themselves as rather hostile towards the concept of mods or a workshop. I wouldn't hold my breath on the expectation that this game is fixed by modders.\n\nAnyway, the game itself is to be described as XCom with gimmick testing \u2026 on a severe budget. The story is pretty much the same, the only difference is that the invasion is already on earth and has taken root instead of coming from outer space. I did notice that much of the gritty horror aesthetic from the earliest promo material has given way to how XCom 2012 and XCom 2 2016 are looking. I assume it's intentional.\n\nFrom here it's XCom: You investigate anomalies leading to combat encounters. You research new stuff. You build your base. There is no real visual for base building, just a \u201ccard system\u201d, I suppose you could call it. Which is odd to me because the tutorial has you fighting on a map that is your factions base. Fairly detailed, too. Probably scrapped in development somewhere. The enemy develops/mutates along side you but I'm not far enough into the game to see if that's truly unique or similar to how XCom throws ever more potent enemies at you every month. There is also diplomacy with other factions but for me that just led to more combat encounters, so yeah. All in all, the impression of great ideas vs. cut-corners in development shines through during every aspect of the game. And while dialing back on what you can achieve is the reality in most game developments today, the \"producer's razor\" is really palpable even to the layman here. \n\nCharacter customization and by extension the players emotional attachment to their band of schmucks doesn't go as far as in XCom. With what I believe to be a bug, everyone keeps their helmet on even when I explicitly say not to. More realistic, I guess, to have everyone look the same status of battle-ready on a battle field but I would like to properly suffer with my goon squad in their moments of heroism and incompetence. For that I need to be able to tell who's who. Right now I can't. It's a really petty gripe, I know. But we're on the topic of comparing to XCom. So there you go.\n\nOn the subject of things that work, the real-time aiming does function as intended and is the thing the game correctly praises itself on. It's very much necessary, too, because enemies soak up a lot of damage. So you want to aim for the head manually every time since your pawns do not know how to aim for shit.\n\nVehicles and giant boss monsters feel properly implemented. Although their behavior becomes easily readable very quickly. Most maps don't accomodate their range and abilities, either. However, that's again a minor gripe for XCom veterans.\n\nThe combat sections do feel a little sluggish. Not because of performance but due to many individual details like model animation, camera controls, unskippable movement sequences. It all comes together to recreate a segment from the behind-the-scenes of XCom's (2012) development where the lead designer talked about how their first prototype was almost unbearably slow, forcing them to cut down on action time, animations and camera controls to make their game more \u201ccrisp\u201d. This refinement hasn't happened here and the game could use something like the \u201cdon't waste my time\u201d-mod for XCom 2.\n\nI am still wondering what they did with all their epic store extra money and one full year of potential additional development. So far the game does not show me any brilliance, just a focus test of features that, I am sure, will make a reprise in other games. Phoenix Point is not bad by any means. Just not grand either.

[/i]\n\n[h1]Time spent with the game[/h1]\n\nI bought Phoenix Point on the EGS a year ago and it's the only game I have been seriously playing since then. I got around 700 hours, counting the beta testing; for comparison I got around +300hours with Xcom2, around 1500hours with XCom EW across different platforms, 70h with Xenonauts, and about a short lifetime with the original X-Coms and JA2. \n\nI have been play-testing beta versions of this YOE release for the past few weeks, which is why I decided to do this review.\n\nI will focus on what is different between the YOE, the previous 1.8 Arkham build (the last version on the EGS before the YOE, and on which most other reviews are based) and the version on release. \n\nIf you are interested in an in-depth look at the gameplay and mechanics, please check out the Mentaculus http://wiki.phoenixpoint.com/Getting_Started. I tried my best to keep it spoiler free. Please note that many changes from Polaris/YOE have not been incorporated yet.\n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\n\n[u]The short version[/u]\n\nPP was very rough on release. Some of us liked it anyway (I proclaimed it a 'masterpiece' in December 2019 and got into a very rich and productive discussion that sometimes resulted in harsh language being exchanged) for what it managed to do and more for what it attempted, but it wasn't in any state where I could recommend it to someone who, well, likes their games kinda finished. \n\nA year later and after beta testing for a few weeks the last YOE build, which is hopefully at least as good as what is getting released, I'm happy to recommend it to the general public. \n\n[u] What has changed [/u]\n\nThe changes since the Epic release on December 3rd 2019 are too numerous to list in a comprehensive manner. It's the kind of stuff you would expect from a 'good' early access release ('good' as in it allowed to play the game from start to finish) and a proper release, but to highlight the main ones:\n\n- Pandoran evolution has been completely redone, so that (depending on difficulty) more dangerous creatures appear later and they come in different strains, and variations within the strains that change from playthrough to playthrough \n- Pandoran deployment has been redone as well, so that now you always get a mix of higher and lower evolved Pandorans \n- Exploration has been redone so that now havens and a special base structure gradually reveal surrounding Points of Interest, and there are 17 bases spread around the globe in fixed locations that you can activate almost from the start of the game\n- The Doomsday Clock has been changed from an abstract 'oneiric delirium index' to a decreasing 'human population census', so you can slow it down by activating bases near the mist and protecting the havens there\n- Skills, abilities, perks, weapons and armors have been rebalanced. Particularly speed has been reduced by about \u00bc - \u2153. \n- Difficulty has been reworked so that Rookie and Veteran are easier\n- The difficulty curve is smoother. Right now the game starts easy and becomes harder (at least until somewhere around mid-game where your operatives can become too powerful)\n- UI has been much improved, there are also stats for soldiers, memorial for the fallen, and end of game stats. \n\nThe Polaris/YOE update has:\n\n- Overdue bug fixes (like with opening crates and dashing/jetpacking\u2026) \n- A proper scripted tutorial and ongoing context tutorial similar to the one in Wasteland 3\n- A reworked tech tree for Phoenix Point; there are 4 new weapons and a deployable shield (and they are all great!) and some minor stuff\n- Drastically reduces modifiers (bonus and malus) to speed and accuracy from armor, and damage buffs as well as some other effects from personal perks. This is a major change as, for example, it makes heavies in heavy armor more accurate, snipers less accurate and cuts on the meta-builds. You can really feel the difference now with the heavies wielding the new autocannon, which is something that many players were asking for \n- There are some improvements to the AI, but less than what was asked for. \n\n[h1]Conclusions[/h1]\n\nThere are many things that PP does that have ruined other XComs and X-Coms for me:\n\n- Realistic [b]ballistics[/b] (vs abstract die rolls), the [b]willpower system[/b] (use of skills and abilities ties into morale), [b]confined RNG[/b] in the tactical battles (the only element of chance is in the trajectory of the projectiles, everything else is deterministic), the [b]strategic layer[/b] (though it could use some improvements in a few departments, it's realized well enough so that you feel like you are part of a world that doesn't spin entirely around you), the [b]flexibility and variety of gameplay styles[/b] (everything can be approached and done in a myriad different ways, both in the tactical and in the strategic layer), [b]mature setting[/b], and the [b]lore[/b]... (the [b]art and the design[/b] is mostly outstanding). \n\nThere are, however, a few things that need to be said: \n\n- PP is, in essence, a [b]table top or a miniatures game with ballistics, not a military simulation[/b].

I'm an avid fan of Xcom and its newer iterations, but this game seems to have lost its way on that path. My biggest gripe about this game is how absurdly clunky everything feels. The addition of all these elements that are intended to add 'depth' like item pickups and the 'manual aim' system really add so many unnecessary steps to a formula that already worked fine. Enemies also don't have any sort of strategy to them, seemingly just throwing themselves at your soldiers until someone gets close enough. \n\nBut god, the manual aim system. I have no idea why this is such a focus feature of this game. You're at the mercy of wherever the game plops the soldier's camera.

I'm going to compare it a lot to XCOM & XCOM2 because it's very similar. Don't like that comparison then quit reading now.\n\n If you like XCOM and/or Xenonauts this is like a love child between the too. It's harder than XCOM2, requiring more strategy and much better tactics. The graphics, base, interface, character customization are nowhere near as good as XCOM2 though so if that's more important to you then this won't blow your skirt up.\n\nWhy is it harder, more strategic, requiring better tactics? Some examples are in no certain order and not complete, just what I noticed in my first night playing - \n\n1) Overwatch is a fan shape instead of everywhere that you can see. Also if you have guys in the overwatch zone a monster/alien could run on the other side of them and you can shoot your own guys. Your guys won't trigger the overwatch but they can be hit by it.\n2) Your bases/soldiers eat food, one more resource to keep track of.\n3) You can't keep everyone happy or alive. In XCOM you could save everyone if you did everything perfect, even on hard difficulties. Not so here. You'll have many choices where someone or something is lost based on the choice. Pretty much from the beginning you'll have these choices.\n4) Weight carried - Soldiers can't carry endless amounts of weight. Strength determines it and some skills improve it. The gear that they carry and armor are heavy so you can't carry much else in the beginning.\n5) You can only reload the ammo that your guy is carrying, run out and you better run up and use your gun like a bat.\n6) anatomy targeting. If you shoot something in the legs it won't run to you or slower if it does, shoot it's arm off and it can't hold a weapon, etc. The shooting physics are much more realistic. Aliens can target you that way too.\n7) more variety of aliens/monsters/enemies right from the start. In XCOM the final missions had different types of aliens using different tactics at the same time to create a challenge. You'll run into that here in your first hour playing.\n\nAnother thing I really like is the BBEG's. I haven't fought any epic bosses yet but you can see pics of them in the loading screens so I'm looking forward to those fights. Aliens can be huge and mega hard. In XCOM the aliens leveled off and androids become harder and harder. Here it's a more organic enemy with tons of variety already in my short play time.\n\nIn short, I really like it and recommend it. XCOM does some things much better, mainly graphics/customizations/voiceovers etc., and this does other things better. I don't think that one has to be better than the other. It seems to me like this will be great and XCOM will still be great too. \n\nI've waited about 24-36 months to play it if not longer, I followed conversations about it when it was just an idea so I'm very happy to finally get to play it here.

If one cannot become MORE on fire as one is fully engulfed(which is fair) then one cannot be harmed fro walking through fire when one is walking through fire anyway..as one is engulfed in it.\n\nI continue to see misses that should not happen as well as burst weapons not having half their rounds find the inner circle..and conspicuous hits from enemies..that would be 1 percent shots using the mechanics as they are purported to apply.\n\nThere is also a strong tendency for sirens to take a direct path to a hidden infiltrator while other, visible targets are in view.\n\nIt would seem this dev cannot resist cheating...mechanics are great..diversity logistics etc..i like the graphics..but you simply cannot cheat on execution of said mechanics(or leave them broken) and have a good tactics game. \n\nThe devs should ask themselves why it is so important to them to fudge numbers because they clearly do..and the game would be pretty fantastic but for this.\n\nOriginal:\n\nThis game is what a tactical game should be.. and is in no small part due to the devs listening to reasoned argument about what was so wrong with the remakes of xcom. It is tactically superior, has better and richer gameplay and is more enjoyable in no small part to a less dependency on dm fiat that has plagued so many tactical and rpg game for many years now. \n\nIt is not without problems, of course. The free aim should allow for camera from corner rather than center(leaning) to avoid some rather silly issues with respect to cover(it isnt hard to mount your gun on a wall or hang it around a corner) but even with this issue(which absolutely should be fixed and fast) it has more tactics, more verisimilitude, and more meaningful choice than anything primarily rng based(particularly true of xcom 2 with 3 and 4 different rngs stacked on top of each other resulting in any choice being mostly guess and prayer, in other words, not tactics. \n\nThe rng is not gone..it is merely in the scope that is fitting..based upon the weapon being used. Not every round of a burst may hit..and that is fair..but you can, and should make it more likely..as a good soldier would.\n\nI do not like the privacy concerns nor the exclusivity that occurred and that is indeed a concern..but this review is about the game..and it is my hope that in this respect at least some follow suit and step up their game, as phoenix point has.\n\nI do not recommend lightly as you can verify should you flip through my other reviews.

So I see myself, like all the Community Councillors, as a critical friend \u2013 someone who can see the huge potential in this game, but who doesn\u2019t hold back from telling the devs in extreme detail why it isn\u2019t great yet.\n\nBecause, let\u2019s face it, when this game was released on Dec 3rd 2019, it was a mess!  The Tutorial sucked, it was really difficult to figure out how the game worked, and if you played it the way that most people played, it generated a difficulty spike that went through the roof in the midgame.\n\nBut all credit to the devs: they listened.  They set up a feedback tool on Canny and created the Community Council: a panel of players drawn from all ends of the spectrum, dedicated to telling them exactly what was wrong with the game and suggesting ways to fix it.  So the game released on Steam is lightyears ahead of the game that was originally released on Epic. \n\nI unashamedly love this game \u2013 though it should be obvious by now that I\u2019m not an uncritical fanboy.  It has the potential to be the best TBS on the market and has effectively retired XCOM for me in its current iterations.  \n\nCompared to XCOM (and let\u2019s face it, everyone compares it to XCOM), its Tactical Layer is much more flexible.  Its AP system is so granular that you can do almost anything you like in whatever order you like (ie. Move, Fire, Move again, recharge your APs and Move some more).  Its ballistic firing system and Location Targeting Reticule give you all kinds of tactical options when firing (do you shoot its head off, take out its weapon, or go for the higher percentage chance to hit?).  The Will Point system gives you even more tactical options and is a pretty decent approximation of Morale (though others would disagree).  Your Squaddies are never limited in what or how much they can carry \u2013 you are perfectly at liberty to arm a Sniper with an HMG, but if you do so (s)he\u2019ll suffer penalties for using a weapon (s)he\u2019s not used to that\u2019s too heavy to carry: but you can always choose to multiclass into a Sniper/Heavy and merge the benefits of both classes.  The enemy as it evolves presents different challenges, and while there isn\u2019t quite enough variety for some, the devs are constantly adding new enemies into the mix.  \n\nThe Strategic Layer looks more limited from a superficial standpoint, but when you dig into it, you discover an open sandbox of a world where you\u2019re faced with multiple branching decisions and rarely enough resources (until the endgame, when you can end up with too many if you know what you\u2019re doing).  Unlike XCOM, the game doesn\u2019t hold your hand, so a lot of this is hidden under the hood.  You\u2019re never presented with a Mission List from which you can only choose one.  Instead, you have to assess the strategic options on the Geoscape and weigh them up for yourself.  Do you respond to that call for help from a Haven on the other side of the continent? Or do you explore that scavenging site to get resources? Do you get the resources you need through Trade?  Or do you commit your limited manpower to that Story/DLC/Diplomatic Mission that is waiting to be resolved?  All of these are possible, but if you don\u2019t prioritise \u2013 or if you try to do them all \u2013 you will be overstretched and inevitably fail.  So you\u2019re constantly weighing up your options and making difficult decisions, even though at times it\u2019s not obvious that you\u2019re doing so.  \n\nBut though this is the game\u2019s biggest strength, it\u2019s also its biggest weakness.  The design philosophy of PP is NOT to restrict player\u2019s options wherever possible.  And this has led at times to some poor (in my view) design decisions.  The most glaring is in Squad Skills.  As I\u2019ve already said, it\u2019s possible to multi-class characters, which opens up a range of extremely powerful synergies \u2013 but because there seems to be an ideological resistance to imposing limitations on skills, some of these synergy builds can get stupidly OP.  Put simply, if you know how to exploit the meta, you can build a Terminator capable of wiping out the enemy\u2019s ability to strike back in the first turn of a mission.  This to my mind is game-breaking and hasn\u2019t been fixed yet: so experienced players who know how to exploit the meta have to play with self-restrictions to keep the endgame challenging.  It\u2019s the classic XCOM Inverse Difficulty Curve writ large, and I still don\u2019t understand why the devs won\u2019t grasp the nettle and fix it.  \n\nSo I play with a series of self-limitations which keep the game challenging and fun, but it\u2019s definitely not ideal.  On the other side of that coin, I can point you to any number of players on the forums who still complain today that the game is too hard, even on the easier levels.  So you can never satisfy everyone.  To my mind, the best way to solve this conundrum would be Second Wave Options, but they don\u2019t seem likely any time soon.  I\u2019m hoping that the modding community will step in and do what the devs either can\u2019t \u2013 or don\u2019t want to \u2013 do, but I\u2019m not holding my breath. \n\nAll that said: this is still a very good, very enjoyable game, and it\u2019s getting better all the time.  \n\nWhat the Epic haters never want to acknowledge is that far from taking the money and running, Snapshot did the exact opposite.  By taking the Epic deal, this mid-weight Indie secured its long-term future, ensuring that it would be around to support and improve the game for years to come; then committed itself to doing just that.  It set up several ways to get feedback from its players and has been acting on that feedback ever since, albeit too slowly for some.  It even sends out regular updates telling you what requests have been acted on and how.  And far from f!ing over any backers who didn\u2019t want to follow it onto Epic, it compensated them for the inconvenience with more than a year\u2019s free DLC (since I believe Festering Skies is also part of the deal).  \n\nIt\u2019s a sad fact of life in the gaming world that virtually no game is released in a fully polished state because there\u2019s never enough time \u2013 and the people who decry a company for crunching its staff to meet impossible deadlines are often (but not always) the same people who troll a company for releasing an incomplete game, or for delaying the release beyond its advertised time.  Snapshot chose to square that circle by releasing the game in a post-beta state and using the time bought by the Epic deal to refine it into a game which \u2013 though it still has some annoying bugs and balancing issues \u2013 is a breath of fresh air in the TBS games market.  Whether you think that was a dick move is entirely up to you, but I certainly don\u2019t think the players who waited for the Steam release are the ones who got a bad deal out of this.\n\nSo while the game you\u2019re getting on Steam is not as slickly polished as XCOM - and JA2 fans will take great delight in telling you all the reasons why it\u2019s not as brilliant as JA2 - it\u2019s still a good game that deserves to be taken on its own merits, rather than for the way its creators ensured they stayed afloat to get it this far.\n\nJust don\u2019t try playing it the way you play XCOM, 'cos if you do you\u2019ll get slaughtered.

Right?\n\nExcept the maps are incredibly small. You get vehicles, but you never have to move them. They can shoot the entire map from the get go.. Got a sniper? Perch him up on a building and he can snipe the whole map.. (no joke). With extreme accuracy... \n\nOh a wall in the way? Don't worry, your pea shooter 9mm pistol will knock down even the thickest concrete barrier with ease.... \n\nMany of these issues were brought up in Alpha, and beta, and even all of year 1 on Epic Store... Devs didn't do a thing about it... \n------------------------\n\nThen you have the World Map.. A spreading red circle showing the spread of the deadly virus and what not.. Pretty cool.. Neutral factions to deal with.. Awesome right? They could be friend or foe, you can steal from them.. and even allies can be enemies.. right? Awesome right? Alliance with factions to gain their tech....No... nope.. nada...\n\nNone of it matters.... \n\nYou're jumping around on the map from point to point... just checking stuff off.. and clearing area's.. You have to scan for these points, but.. the whole task becomes extremely boring and lack luster very early on... boring, bland maps... and when walls can be shot through and destroyed with a simple pistol, makes half the \"cover\" in the game pointless... (I've had my guy hiding behind a concrete barrier get his cover destroyed by a pistol many times... now he's out in the open, and all the other enemies get free shots on him). \n\nIts even more abuseable by the player, since the player can free aim if he knows an enemy is behind 3 walls.. just free aim and shoot.. knock down all 3 walls with the first 3 bullets and the rest will hit the target... GG.... \n\n--------------------\n\nTo make matters worse the whole factoin system is rather dull as well.. You get text boxes with options and depending on which option you choose your alignments go up or down with them.. Alliance to get their tech, or just steal it... \n\nStealing it is 100x faster and easier, without the headache. \n\n---------------------\n\nThen you come across the major issues... Like bugs that are still in the game from BETA>.. yes... BETA bugs from nearly 2 years ago.. STILL in the game... \n\nYou still have game breaking issues with certain story missions as well... just got to the end of a mission and need to grab something, but the ladder got busted because every wall can be destroyed by breathing on it? Too bad... you gotta restart the mission and hope the enemies don't destroy it in their grenade spams... \n\nEven the very first mission you go on, can be rendered unbeatable because the SINGLE LADDER you need to climb up could be destroyed with 1 bullet.. making you have to restart.... \n\nThis problem and sooooo many more have been brought up, talked about, and begged to be fixed on Phoenix Points discord channel all through Alpha, Beta, and release for the past 2 years.... And they still haven't fixed it... \n\n-----------------------------\n\nThis then comes to the lack luster DLCs... 1st DLC added a few armors.. yay? I guess....\n\nSecond DLC added some weapons.. yay.. I guess again... \n\nthird DLC seems kinda cool but cant' be bothered to get to it due to how boring and lack luster the rest of the game is.... \n\n---------------------\n\nAND then that doesn't add in the final touches.. Breaking promises it won't be Epic Exclusive for a year, which it did, then promising big game changing DLCs.. which.. none of them were... and then of course, the dlc which is gonna be a game changer is now no longer part of the original backers dlcs... so they did the old switcharoo, because that DLC will actually be worth something... \n\n-------------------------\n\nTLDR: Buy this game if its like... 15$.. otherwise Xcom 2 is way better, and far far more content...\n\n-----------------\n\nEdit: I'm actually going to add this bit, because people are commenting once in awhile and a few individuals keep responding that PP has depth and I'm wrong. Pointing out things such as the Free Aim, etc. \n\nWhat makes me so disappointed in Phoenix Point is the fact that these mechanics SHOULD add depth to the game, but they don't because of flamboyantly stupid game design decisions surrounding these mechanics, making them at best a gimmick, or pointless, and removing any and all depth they otherwise should have added. \n\nExample which several like to bring up is the Free Aim. If Walls didn't get destroyed in literally 1 volley of a weapon, then this mechanic would in a heart beat become a very in depth, and intricate mechanic, that adds depth to the game. \n\nhowever, because walls can be destroyed so incredibly easy and without effort, it completely takes away from this mechanic, making it a gimmick that doesn't matter. \n\nAnd that's how pretty much all aspects of PP is... mechanics which should have brought depth and interesting game play, killed off because of stupid game design decisions surrounding it...", "timestamp_created": 1607036742, "timestamp_updated": 1607356950, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1538, "votes_funny": 31, "weighted_vote_score": "0.894880294799804688", "comment_count": 152, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81554844": {"recommendationid": "81554844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004980955", "num_games_owned": 474, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 4767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1608358264}, "language": "english", "review": "As an Early Backer who got burned when they went epic exclusive for a year but decided now to treat this as its own thing (I am going to be fair).\nI will say that:\n\n-They did some innovative things with the combat system and enemies evolution. \n-They do work on it constantly so assuming nothing befalls Julian it will keep on being refined.\n-It can be a fun game once you figured out what you are doing (This is the meh part, might not be mainstream friendly). \n\n-Yes, it is a pretty bad decision to go epic exclusive for a year, but the state of the game back then vs now, Steam got the almost complete iteration (where is my festering sky?) compared to bareboneness back on epic. \n\nPeople will compare this to Xcom 2, and this would come up short due to being released too early (Even now.

[/url] [/td] [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nPhoenix Point: Year One Edition is a turn-based strategy game with global strategy elements from the creator of X-COM and you'll notice this immediately. Phoenix Point is like XCOM in many ways. \nFirst off, Phoenix Point was released one year ago exclusively on the Epic Store. Now it is available on steam with all of it's DLC's and a big discount. \n\nThe story is told through dynamic pictures and voice-overs. The Pandoravirus broke out. People infected are going to mutate into some kind of monsters. It starts interesting enough for a strategy game. \nThere also seem to be different fractions in the game but I can't tell more about that yet. \n\nBut the most important thing are the turn-based fights. As I said, you'll immediately feel right at home if you've played X-COM before. It basically plays like XCOM with a few different and new mechanics and a few changes overall. For example, your units have 4 AP instead of 2. Also, in XCOM when you move within a blue zone, no matter where exactly, 1 AP is used. Here, you can move halfway through the blue zone, stop, and move on. If your unit is moving and an enemy appears within the line of sight, your unit will stop. This lets you react accordingly to the situation. This is one of the many improvements compared to X-COM. \n\nAnother new mechanic is called \"free shot\". If you want to shoot a target, you can decide whether your unit shoots automatically or you do it like in an FPS. The camera changes to first-person and you can aim and shoot by yourself. This is an exciting new feature because it goes hand in hand with a new mechanic called \"realistic ballistics\". This means, that objects that cover certain parts of the body will protect the unit. So, let's say there is a wall between your character and the enemy. The wall covers half of the enemy's body. If you shoot, you can't hit the parts of the body that are covered. \n\nAnother thing PP does differently is if comrades are within your line of fire. There is a chance you'll hit them partially. This is nothing new to the genre in general but compared to the last XCOM games. \n\nIn XCOM, if no enemy is in sight, you'll hear them and get a notification that shows you where they approximately are. In PP, this is the same but you get to see exactly where they are just not if it's an enemy and which one or a friendly unit. You also can hear what they do but not if a shot was successful, etc. \n\nYou can take up to 8 units on a mission AND a vehicle. Units can be transported with it and vehicles can move and shot without a unit in them.\n\nEvery unit can carry some items with them. You can carry up to three weapons, items, etc. with you and immediately use them. Let's say you have a weapon and additional ammo. Reloading does not cost AP if you carry ammo in one of them. Additionally, every unit has a backpack (not visible). How much they can carry is limited and if you have ammo in the backpack, you'll need to spend AP for reloading. This is a small detail but can be the difference between shoot or getting shot. \n\nAside from the turn-based battles, there is Global strategy involved. It resembles X-COM's base management. You also have a base you'll need to take care of, upgrade, etc. You can move around with your space plane and discover new places. Every move takes time (flying to a new place takes X hours, etc.). All of the options available seem to be detailed and just as complex as in XCOM but I can't give a final judgment about that since I didn't play that much yet.\n\nUnits gain EXP after every mission. Every level up gives them skill points you can spend to unlock new abilities or upgrades.  You also get skill points after every mission which will go into a shared pool. Every unit can use these.\n\nLoading times are pretty long. Especially loading times BEFORE a mission are very long compared to XCOM even on a good rig. This can be annoying. There also was a bug at release which didn't let you activate the DLC's even though you own them. They fixed it a few hours after release but it still sucks because you need to start a new campaign to use them. It doesn't matter for anyone buying the game now, but this is something that should NOT happen considering the game was already out on epic. \n\nOverall Phoenix Point: Year One Edition is perfect for anyone loving X-COM and turn-based strategy games in general. I can't recommend it enough. The turn-based fights are detailed with much love and bring in new and exciting mechanics. After playing approx. 2 hours, you can easily tell which level of quality and detail this game has. But to be fair, 2 hours isn't enough to go into detail about everything (e.g. global strategy). All the options seem detailed and promise to be just as \"complex\" as in X-COM (if you want to call it complex at all).\n\nI will update my review after playing more accordingly but this sure as hell get's a recommendation especially since it's on sale. It's definitely worth 25\u20ac/USD. Just get it already, you'll love it!\n\n[table]\n\t    [tr] [td] [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38553778-All-about-Strategy-Games/] If you like my review and strategy games, please consider following my curator page on Steam!

That with how they developers treat their fans, I can't recommend putting money on this.\nHopefully they fixed stuff now that it's out on steam- Already noticed a few annoying things, like game switching screen when you start up and then you gotta change and restart the game to switch monitor & hope it chooses correctly or it's back to restarting, borderless/window mode and game tabs down completly, story cinematic completly out of sync with text and visual images?...

But 9/10 times you just aim for the head, because why not?

Quite to the contrary \u2013 accustomed to the glamor and glitter of X-Com 2, at first I was disappointed year ago and regretted that I donated (initially it looked worse than now). But I gave the game a chance \u2013 and that was the best I could do.\nThe game revealed itself gradually. Every difference from X-Com 2 was a revelation. The most serious Sci-fi story. Independent factions with their own havens to build relationships with. Many classes, but not only that - the ability to combine them, so that you can create anyone, even a berserk-sniper. An unprecedented variety of enemies. Realistic ballistics and a very complex firing system - each bullet does its own damage. Destructability of everything - if you wish, you can raze the entire map to the ground. The ability to disable the enemy as you wish \u2013 there\u2019s no necessity to kill him. Tons of weapons with any damaging factor. Transport. Battle beasts. Mutations! Augmentation! GOD DAMNED FLAMETHROWER!!! I haven\u2019t never seen anything similar. The king of tactics and X-Com 3 was hiding behind an unprepossessing signboard. After playing Phoenix Point, I tried to play X-Com 2 and was surprised - it was so boring. It was like missing a lot of vital things that I'm already accustomed in Phoenix Point. And if you also consider that the next DLC will contain air battles...\nSeveral responses to particularly frequently encountered points of criticism.\n\"Raw game\". I don't even quite understand what that means.

I do not know in what mode and for how long the game was tested by those who say about \"a tons of bugs\". In 260 hours of playing, I saw 3 bugs that have already been fixed.\n\"The game does not have that one, the other, the third...\". All who say so forget one (the most important thing) - this is not an AAA class game, but INDY. Created with donations.

You will find yourself in a familiar situation: lead the Earth defence, this time against [i]Pandoravirus[/i] and its alien-looking offsprings, [i]pandorans[/i].\n\n[h3][i]X-COM[/i][/h3]\n[b]One of the core concepts of the original is the broad scope[/b]: turn-based tactics expanded with a strategy together with role-playing elements and unfold the narrative with research. All [i]X-COM[/i] descendants try to find the essence of its identity but many don't acknowledge the [b]reversed difficulty curve[/b] immersion. You start in a desperate situation but every day, every looted alien tech get you closer to victory and makes even a failed mission success and enjoyment.\n\nThe [i]Firaxis's[/i] re-creations chased the [i]X-COM[/i] spirit but not always the design. Some of the game\u2019s systemic elements were replaced by discrete choices but each of them was meaningful and kept player in control. Solomon's streamlined titles were able to preserve the scope of the original and the rewarding feeling of progress.\n[b][i]Phoenix Point[/i] inclines toward more complexity[/b].\n\n[h3]Ballistics[/h3]\nThe major [i]Phoenix Point[/i] appeal is the [b]first-person free-aim shooting[/b] with [b]realistic bullet trajectories[/b]. Additional tactical options lies in [b]destructible environment[/b] and the [b]location-targeting system[/b]. Alas, the [b]intriguing concept clashes with clumsy design[/b]:\n\nEffects are bound to crippling a location, not just hitting, and are quite limited: weapon unusable, disabling related ability, [i]Movement[/i] or [i]Will Power[/i] penalty. There are no damage multipliers or temporal effects like losing action points, decreasing accuracy, falling, or dropping a weapon... Enemies with strong skills are very susceptible to location targeting, e.g.: [i]Siren's[/i] head with [i]Mind Control[/i], but against many others, you are just pouring bullets into the same spot (even though the body part has been already destroyed) because you have already lowered armour rating there or it is easiest to hit.\n\nThe ballistics also diminishes the effectiveness of cover dependent on the attacking angle. The decision to add melee weapons, or rather high mobility to make those weapons viable, makes the issue more apparent.\n\n[h3]Sense of Progression[/h3]\n[i]Phoenix Point[/i] strikes off on its own path with [b]marginal equipment upgrades[/b]. You rarely get anything clearly better than what you had before. It is an interesting approach which gives you more options but it has a price: [i]Phoenix Point[/i] with its [b]heavy emphasis on soldiers[/b] is more [i]RPG[/i] and less [i]strategy[/i] than [i]Firaxis[/i] titles. The game offers a decent amount of classes. One skill per level may seem like a poor relative to [i]Firaxis's[/i] characters but the disappointment quickly fades once you will realise that you can multi-class.\n\nYour soldiers will gradually become [i]Gods of Destruction[/i] as [b]right skills can completely change the situation from desperate to trivial[/b]. To counter your super-powers [i]pandorans[/i] will grow thick shells and become bullet-sponges with several hundred to higher thousands [i]HP[/i] and even the basic enemy, [i]arthron[/i], will rip through the heaviest armour and kill your best guy in one turn. The lethality results in [i]Blitzkrieg[/i] scenarios: [i]\"must kill them before they can act\"[/i]. While it keeps battles challenging it is prone to unfair deaths and diminishes the sense of progression.\n\n[h3]Randomness[/h3]\nMissions are randomly generated based on the objective and hostile faction: [i]pandorans[/i], mutated [i]forsaken[/i], cyberware [i]pure[/i] or fellow humans. [b]The game will randomly pick some enemies and spread them around the map without any logic.[/b] This wonky design of making everything random and [i]different[/i] leads to the feeling of everything being the same.\n\nThe mid and late-game is a slog as you are locked in the neverending heaven defences. While the game knows a few mission types, most fall to the annoying [i]\"timer\"[/i] category and heaven defence is its prominent member: you must do the mission immediately and you don't defend against [i]pandorans[/i], you have to kill enemies fast before they destroy a facility. Unfortunately, enemies may spawn next to the objective which you are supposed to defend giving you no chance to prevent a mission failure the first or second turn. A [b]high level of randomness[/b] sometimes plays in your favour and you are done within 2 turns, another time you are killed by an undetectable sniper. Some enemies are well-thought with their strengths and weaknesses, like face-hugging [i]fragger[/i], others are absurd: artillery which can pacificate your troops with a single lucky volley fire cross the whole map.\n\n[h3]Strategy[/h3]\nFaithful to the original, you will manage bases, research, manufacturing and training recruits. Unlike [i]X-COM[/i], where you had to cover the globe with bases and radars to scan for randomly appearing UFOs, [i]Phoenix Point[/i] [b]generate the globe with all possible mission locations when you start the campaign[/b]. Those are revealed around bases with active radar or by visiting nearby friendly heavens. For some strange reason, all locations serve as gas stations for your aircraft. As you explore them you get a random event: a mission or just resources covered with a bit of well-written storytelling.\n\nThree ideologically distinct rival factions are what was left from our civilization: authoritative [i]New Jericho[/i], anarcho-syndicalist commune of [i]Synedrion[/i] and theocratic [i]Disciples of Anu[/i]. None of them is morally better than the others and each of them offers unique technologies and character classes. Sadly, [b]diplomacy is eviscerated to raiding outposts[/b] and special [i]\"graduating\"[/i] missions.\n\nDo you remember [i]X-Com 2[/i] and its [i]cash/intel/alloys[/i] with a separate way of acquisition and usage to make the strategy more engaging? [i]Phoenix Point[/i] uses three easily swappable resources: [i]food[/i], [i]material[/i] and [i]tech[/i]. You can produce only [i]food[/i] and you are forced for a [b]pointless trade[/b]. It is hard to believe that such veteran designer as Julian Gollop wouldn't immediately see that it is the same thing as having only one resource with the added chore.\n\nIt is not the only issue with the peculiar economy: the price of a new aircraft is barely equivalent to equipping two soldiers. Strangely, 90% weapons will be automatically destroyed even with a head-shot of the owner prohibiting you to loot it. Even ammo for the basic weapons is quite expensive and will cost you appr. 50% of mission rewards.\n\nOverall, the strategic layer of [i]Phoenix Point[/i] feels like a placeholder. It somehow works but the obvious and ignored design flaws are depressing. [i]Snapshot[/i] even made the situation worse by the recent re-design of thematic Lovecraftian progression-meter to a [i]Doomsday Clock[/i].\n\n[h3]Final Thoughts[/h3]\nMarch 2019: Julian Gollop announced 1-year [i]Epic[/i] store exclusivity. I appreciate [i]Epic[/i] support but I understand why many backers feel betrayed. To avoid the tension [i]Snapshot[/i] closed communication. [i]Phoenix Point[/i] has fresh ideas but feels like being designed by people who don't speak to each other. Some parts are outright woeful, some others just do not fit to the rest of the game in any logical manner. Yet, among all Firaxis's progeny [i]Phoenix Point[/i] is one of the best but frequently wide where it should be deep.\n\n[code]I have hundreds of hours and several successful gameplays on highest dificulty in both original [i]X-COM[/i] and [i]Phoenix Point[/i].[/code]", "timestamp_created": 1607021769, "timestamp_updated": 1607148376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 364, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.827413439750671387", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "92098723": {"recommendationid": "92098723", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972172084", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1321, "playtime_at_review": 994, "last_played": 1621189423}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked the new XCOM's but i felt it was missing something, it was almost there but not quite. \nI thought Phoenix Point would be more or less the same, maybe little more boring to play but oh boy, how wrong was i. \nThis is the game what those new XCOM's should have been.

There after I have not followed the game much. But after the Year one edition comes out in steam and with a good price reduction, I decided to try the game again. At this price point this is a great game to have with all those DLCs. My views about the game in general are below,\n\nPros:  \n\n1. Very much XCOM like but with some CRPG vibe. \n\n2. Great value for money at current price point and with 3 DLC. You may at least get 20-30 hours of play time even if you are sped through all the quests. If some want to experience everything then it may take 50+ hours in single playthrough. \n\n3. Realistic ballistics mechanic is very hyped and although some time very annoying it may well be fun when you grasped the basic. \n\n4. Three factions and their different tech tree provide good variations and tactical intricacies which many player will love. \n\n5. Good story, its not perfect but did not hinder any player in any way\n\n6. The devs at Snapshot games are enthusiastic and always try to improve the game by means of patches. This is a very good sign. \n\nCONS:\n\n1. Even if stated otherwise this game is actually a survival strategy game with some XCOM like RPG mechanics. You have to find ways of survival in every minute. It takes away some enjoyment at the beginning. \n\n2. There has been very little hand holding at the geoscape / strategy layer. You have to take diplomatic and tactical decisions on your own. It may pose difficult to understand at first. \n\n3. The game is not very much beginner friendly, you have to understand the core mechanics and need to read the game wiki at first. \n\n4. There has been some weird difficulty spike even in lowest difficulty level. Unlike other games, here Early game is pretty much cakewalk, Mid game is very difficult and late game is some what less difficult than mid game. The devs are constantly patching the game and hopefully it will be balanced more in the future.  \n\n\nOverall verdict: \n\nA go-to game for RPG and XCOM lovers if you enjoy hard survival strategy games. \n \n", "timestamp_created": 1620570259, "timestamp_updated": 1620570259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559041976928711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "91708164": {"recommendationid": "91708164", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965344051", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5370, "playtime_at_review": 2712, "last_played": 1621131238}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like X-com play it.", "timestamp_created": 1620565245, "timestamp_updated": 1620565245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "91601814": {"recommendationid": "91601814", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983973145", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2313, "playtime_at_review": 956, "last_played": 1621128083}, "language": "english", "review": "Much better than XCom 2.

I will cover both and then mention some overall game play elements.\n\nThe strategic game is, in my opinion, superior to the recent XCom reboots in every way. It is not simply and random RNG excuse for supplies or a few story mission placements but there is actual game play value in the layer. Later in the game, it can take a bit of getting used to since so many things are going on, but I feel the game did a very good job on this aspect of the game.\n\nThe tactical layer, however, is where the game finds itself lacking a bit. First off, the maps are very limited and not randomly generated. As the game is much longer than an XCom play through, this can make things a bit tedious and feeling representative as you go through the missions. I do like that the aliens are spread over the map, active since the beginning of the mission and not sitting around in 'pods' waiting for you to discover and pick apart at your whim.\n\nOverall though, the game lacks any kind of progression curve like you find in XCom. Most of the research is rather useless and makes no sense for many items (why do I need to research an alien to unlock shotguns in the year 2047?). Furthermore, there really is no progression tech wise. Most weapons are similar in the game with slight variation in their stats (one offers higher damage and range, while one may offer lower damage, shorter range and armor penetration but neither is necessarily better than the other). The lack of progression in weapons is rather peculiar considering all the aliens in the game have a progression as the game goes on (most aliens progressing through five levels). This does keep the game a challenge throughout, but I feel they could have had some kind of progression to at least keep up with the alien progression throughout the game.\n\nI do like that the game has a bit more complexity than XCom but some of it is there for the sake of being there. For example, in 2021, there is really no need in a tactical game of soldiers to have to manage ammo inventory. It adds nothing to the game and is nothing more than a tedious step for the sake of being there. In a RPG fine, but not a game where you are managing 12-24 soldiers.\n\nTo conclude, the game does offer an alternative XCom experience, though with many enough difference you should not play like XCom.

No. Like all games, including XCom, it has it's places it does well and others that could use improvement and therefore, if what I mentioned above would be okay with you in a game, than I would recommend purchasing it.", "timestamp_created": 1620003105, "timestamp_updated": 1620003105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.55486762523651123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "91324541": {"recommendationid": "91324541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016378550", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 3699, "last_played": 1620001092}, "language": "english", "review": "As soon as you get to a point where you understand this is not XCOM 3, you will be ok.

Nor is it in any resemblance. After playing for about 19 hours, I seriously tried to give this game a chance. Even attempted to obtain some achievements. But from my personal experience playing this game; I'll put it under one description.\n\nThe Game Is Hard.\nAfter playing for the first in-game month, it wasn't so bad. Had good starting point; game wasn't too difficult, and was fun to play. Then came the second month... when my squad was absolutely wiped out in a single mission. At first I was like; \"Wait... what...?\" it's like the game suddenly cranked up the difficulty dial and made there enemies non-killable or impossible to take down. At first I thought this was a problem on me, not understanding how the strategy worked.\n\nSo I went online trying to find solutions; and I discovered that there are no armory upgrades aside from what you'll obtain from factions. And not much gear upgrades besides shields and vehicles. Not to mention the time limit you have. The time limit is not the biggest issue when playing this, as there are lots of ways to slow it down and decrease the time.\n\nIt is difficult to obtain your own resources. The only way for you to get resources in early game is by factions. Either it being raiding or assisting them. But I found it more beneficial to just steal there resources. So I find myself running out of ideas in how to make myself stronger or better; adding the difficulty to have to upgrade my soldier's gears one-by-one. Do you know how expensive that is to make sure your troops are set up in gear? Without a full set of armor you can expect them to be one-shotted. But that doesn't necessarily matter; as you get into about the second month give or take? Your troops will be gun downed if one troop fires at you. And most enemies in this stage all have counter attacks, so you can expect your troops getting one-shotted with-in one turn.\n\nAs I said; I seriously tried to like this game. And I do! I love the concept and the ideas. I love the challenge and the hard game. But there are serious issues that need repaired. Where it stands and you're deciding rather or not to get this game?\n\nI would say don't.

While the reflexive response of most people seems to be comparing it to XCOM (which isn't a bad thing per say) there are plenty of things setting it apart from being an out and out XCOM clone. \n\nOne of the things that stick out the most to me is the fact that you only have to make sacrifices/trade-offs regarding what missions you take and which you don't if you don't have enough soldiers/aircraft built up, rather than a static pick 1 of 3 like in XCOM. While this is balanced by the fact that travel times exist and you aren't guaranteed to be able to reach a mission in time (if your aircraft is on the other side of the world or something, for example) as well as the potential for a ton of active missions popping up at once, I really like the fact that my ability to respond at any given time is something dependent on the effort I've put in developing and such rather than a static value.\n\nThis also means that just because you have a capped out A or B team, developing more units and squads has actual value as even half a dozen or more teams can be genuinely useful rather than just more units you developed just because. It really feels like your developing into more and more of a powerhouse as the game goes on and your ranks swell to dozens of soldiers that actively see combat rather than just a rotation of the same 6-10 doing everything.\n\nSomething else I really like is that weapons don't have a real linear development tree, which makes building up a varied arsenal both viable and important.  Instead of the blunt this is better than that of XCOM different versions of the same weapon class excel against different enemies and in different situations. Accuracy, Armoring shredding potential, firing AP cost, Damage per shot, type of damage (out of conventional, virus, paralyze), number of shots per burst, and even the cost of ammunition are all things to consider. This is something that extends to armor as well, seeing as different types give different bonuses with focuses on protection, accuracy bonuses, stealth bonuses, movement, etc.\n\nLeveling up an individual soldier is also quite a developed and in depth process, with things like hybrid classes giving a tremendous amount of a possible variations regarding a units skill set. With assignable points both from level ups and as flat gains for every mission a unit takes part in, its possible to unlock every skill (for a unit's given main/secondary class) and max all 3 stats given enough time, and although that is a very long winded process, the difference between a recruit and a fully improved soldier is tremendous and (given how long it takes) something that feels well and truly earned when you finally work your way up to it.\n\nWhile i could go into other things ranging from the shooting system to the almost dead space style of killing your enemies limb by limb, I've already ranted enough and i feel like plenty of other people have touched on those things.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1619824005, "timestamp_updated": 1619824005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "91029826": {"recommendationid": "91029826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164977014", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 47, "playtime_at_review": 1148, "last_played": 1620324596}, "language": "english", "review": "Just enough like XCOM to be familiar and innovative enough to feel fresh.
