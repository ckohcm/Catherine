XCOM but gangsters? I'm in. Unfortunately, the buggyness makes it nearly unplayable. One bug, which inspired this review, occurs when a character has the \"Hair Temper\" trait (chance to get three attacks/actions upon a friendly taking damage) and the \"Strike and Move\" ability (gets one free move upon killing an enemy). When combined, this leads to the game trying to let you move on the enemy's turn, soft-locking the game since you cant move on the enemy's turn. This one in particular has lost me around three hours of my life, as well as prevented me from participating in the two safehouse raids (boss fights) ive done so far (to skip the bug, I had to let the game auto-battle; essentially a coin flip based on each side's combat power).

If i had to sum it up in one word it'll be this: Disappointing. Seriously. i love the concept and I want more games like this but not like this! okay lets start with the first issue. Graphics. let this sentenace sink into your soul, Only Ai Capone and Frankie Donoven have good models. everyone either looks like they've been dipped in wax, have way to small eyes, look like 5 people designed the characters with no commication, or just plain ugly. now beauty is in the eye of the beholder so i'll stop there and move on to more pressing issues. like say: Gameplay. \n\nits a stratigy game with all of 1920s Chicago as your playground, the abilliy to go to street view and see your guys and gangster you hire run around... run around... RUN AROUND! Thats right! no driving! in 1920s Chicago, where car chases between gangs was common place. now there is a fast travel system but its only for one or two places per district. slowly running to each location like a idiot with nothing to do. okay thats not entirely true, you can, like i said eariler, enter Derelect buildings and claim them as your own or ransack, or smash up, or completly destroy them, i'll get to that fustercluck in a minute but lets talk about something else, like..\n\nThis is a longer segment so here's the TLDR: M E N U S, no reason to trade with minor factions due to patch (not there fault just a unfortnate side effect) Time hate you, Cheating is encrouged, No reason to trade for guns, Business Arangemments are worthless\n\nBooze, Trading and Management, or as i like to call it M E N U City. its a bunch of block of uninteresting menus where you select what type of alcohol your making, whats selling, and switch it. its a fine system, not good but not great, but there trading! yeah, you can buy stuff off the black market or the police if they like you (you can improve relations with money which is quick and simple, no problems there) or trade your guns, booze and other crap to other gangs, either Major or minor factions, now this sounds good, just one issue... Time. you see theres one thing i've haven't mentioned till now..... Theres no way to speed up time without cheating, Yeah, and it takes like 5 or 7 minutes for a day to pass, assuming you don't pause or fight anyone, this would be one thing but everything restocks after 60 days, when you can just ransack the thug buildings, or find randomly spawning crates and get stuff for free without much effort. also i lied there two issues, minor factions only want and have alochol, meaning that they should avoided like the plague. this isn't that big of a deal but you can disguse boozer and get rich right, no, thats a exploit that was patched. good for devlopers for wanting to fix their game while making minor faction trading even more pointless\n\nBusiness Arangemments are worthless. see you can set up arrangments with other bosses to cheapen your operations, but theres even a issue with that, i'm tried of saying that, they are so minor, that i didn't notice, its like a 2% decrease to whatever and theres no hiking it up. plus your have to see the repeated lines over and over, speaking of\n\nVoice acting\n\nEveryone that isn't a Boss makes is disappointing. they all have 2 or 3 lines of dialoge per person and some are reused from other gangster (this is rare though), plus most of that is dumb comments like \"YAeH, i'M oN It, yOU goT iT BoSs,hOt DAmn and thats not even the worst part...... they have one victory line that loops every win you get and its same same stupid lines from chesey voices that reek of: we tried way too hard to make everyone unique. \n\nGangsters\n\nYou can't run a empire alone, you need gangsters to help you.... You know what im gonna say, everyone feels the same! they tell you that the roles mean something, like the con artist, the hired gun, etc but only one means anything is Demolition as it lets you blow buildings off the map, they all have traits but they don't matter in the grand scoop and some are locked away depending on your noteirity which.... is the only saving grace.\n\nCombat\n\nSpeaking of, this is the worst part of the game, now you can auto skip which is fine (it also had to be added later) but lets say you want to fight yourself. well then time for a round of patience comes to die, for some stupid reason, there's a D&D style initiative roll which DOESN'T TRANSLATE WELL TO A VIDEO GAME ABOUT CHARACTER PLACEMENT AND COVER!! This means that depending on how much you initiative you have, you'll have to wait for every mook to run like they arms weigh 50 pounds. then theres the fact that theres no mutiple floors, all the rooms 2 varients, theres 2 shooting animations, 1 stabbing animation, 2 melee animations, and 5 execution animations.... IN TOTAL!, and nobody shuts up!\n\nPresentation\n\nThere's nothing, when you start the game, you get a cutscene to introduce your boss and there stories, the stories? they generic mob shit, Capone has a friend from new york, Frankie has a sibling thing, etc. as for the cutscene's, well you just snap right into it. no unique flair, not smooth transition, nothing. the in game cutscene's are worse as its just text boxes talking with 2 or 3 lines you cans say back. i wound prefer a Danganronpa, or Phonix Wright like sprites with a few lines spoken and little comments\n\nCheats\n\nOh Yeah, There's cheats, but there s issue with that. as menstion way back at the start. you cannot speed up the game without cheating.............. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CHEAT TO SPEED UP A RTS!!!!!!!\n\nDLC\n\nonly one is worth it. the one where you get 4 new mobster. the rest your useless garbage like One new execution, or Al Capone with a fur jacket\n\nPositives\n\nwell i went on a rant just then... its just.. i wanted this game to be good because i believed there was something good and there was, the Voicing for the bosses is pretty good and its clear that the creaters care about this game, but to me, its not enough to do your homework, its not enough to promise things to come, i want a fun game here and now and i'm afraid that for now. this game gets a 3/10 (i'm trying a number thing)", "timestamp_created": 1618967329, "timestamp_updated": 1619032308, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50228351354598999", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "90604990": {"recommendationid": "90604990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112157368", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 429, "playtime_at_review": 616, "last_played": 1619248818}, "language": "english", "review": "its cool", "timestamp_created": 1618880715, "timestamp_updated": 1618880715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "90592179": {"recommendationid": "90592179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061922148", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 489, "playtime_at_review": 3011, "last_played": 1619037775}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a fan of mafia games, empire building and tactical battle. This game should be a home run for me but it is just ok at this point. I think this game has a lot of strong foundation to it and I like how things interact with each other in a balancing act.\n\nfew things I really think would help.\n1. If your guys uses a bandage in a fight and you have bandages in storage it should auto refill it. Zero fun micro managing stuff like that.\n2. I am a gangster not a hobbo. There should be 4-5 taxi cab in each area. Waiting a minute while your guys slowly walk across a zone is very fun. Or allow you to have different speeds to move at. game speed x2 or x4 option.\n3. If you have a healer in your group, it should heal everybody up post fight. It is something you can do manually. why make people waste time doing it? waste of time and no fun.\n4. The minor factions are a cool addition to the game. Something I havent seen in other similar games. The issue is they are dumb and you just focus on them to build your empire. Especially on harder levels they should be getting protection from the bigger factions so they are just not free buildings.\n5. Having a guy assigned to each area of town is a cool touch as somebody who over sees it but once you have 5-6 safe houses that is half your army out of the fight. I would rather see like your boss can have two named guys with him and then has to fill out with the generic thugs. Your underboss can have up to one other named guy with him and then generic guys. The rest of your dudes just get generic guys. It would allow you then to have effectively a handful of crews in town who could all be doing their own thing. Right now I just have a big mob of guys going around to take \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. It is such a pain in the ass to reassign people to zones that I tend to ignore the bonus and dont have people in them because I would rather having the really tough fighting group.\n6. The npc AI is really bad. far too often they have a shot but instead waste movement and get no shot off. Or they move into position then reload. If they need to reload that should always be their first action then decide to shoot or move to cover.\n7. The other factions dont seem to buy many of the NPC, and the ones they have I dont ever see. If you have eyes in a zone it should show you on the map if a named guy is moving around with a crew so you could see an ambush coming or ambush them on the street. I have a feeling they just end up sitting in safe houses so add really nothing to the game.\n8. The quest log view needs to be upgraded. Only showing one quest at a time is a pain. No reasons you could not have color coded markers for quests so you could see several on the map at a time. Otherwise you could be standing by a quest guy and not even know it because that quest is not your one of focus.\n9. Police and Bureau having more of a presents in the game outside of random raids. They should have buildings to mess with. Agents on the street that go at you more, and you can go at them.\n10. when I am at war with a faction there is a real disconnect between the war. It is only really attacking their buildings random or they randomly attack yours. More of that fighting happening on the streets would be cool. Being able to have patrols in areas you control. Being able to ambush their patrols etc. The fighting on the streets is going to bring down heat from police which would lead to them having more patrols and starting to shake down local rackets .\n11. Instead of having Chicago police, having police by area of town. You may have strong influence with little Italy police but that doesnt mean you would have that same influence in Chinatown.\n12. Having either two entrances to come into the safe house from or starting on the street and having to fight into the safe house. I actually like the second better. Currently you are just clumped into the front door and if they have NPC that go early you get grenades dropped on your full group. No real tactical aspect to this. just luck of the draw of who goes early and if they are in grenade range of your party. If you have to start on the streets behind cars while they were in the windows, you would have to fight your way into the house with them having cover advantage. Could have to do so much damage to the front door to get access. After so many rounds police could show up and make the fight even uglier but it would create the need to push the offense instead of just playing defensive.\n\nThe game is poor right now but I feel like it has the foundation to be a great game. The AI is so amazingly bad in combat that is makes it hard to even want to play.

There is less than 1% of actual historical accuracy in this game and that are some names, and that is all. (and even that they screwed)\n\nThere is no strategy aspect of game, every match/new game plays exactly the same. \n-You pick one of 14 bosses,run around the districts and click on loot boxes until you find good weapons, than trade those weapons to other bosses for one of their OP weapon and start killing and leveling your boss until he can solo the whole game. Forget the gangsters that you can hire, they are useless and who wants to be mob boss and have gangsters like; Pirate, Surgeon, General, Soldier in army clothes, Savannah hunter, Prosthetic gangster and much more in your borgata (1920 Chicago LOL). \n-Rackets are useless, as they take more money for starting them, than you can ever get back from them.\n-Police is there just for decoration and getting killed.\n-Judges and other aspects of law are missing\n-Enemy's dont expand, they start with 5-6 rackets and for most of the time, they end with the same number of rackets.\n-AI could be named AS (Artificial Stupidity) \n-Story is non existent and those sub stories that they have are made of 4 parts: talk to this person, go there, kill that person, return for reward. \n-Combat aspect is ripping from Xcom series so hard, but how dumb it looks in the end its about luck and nothing about position or strategy. Hint: dont start fight when cops are near, as you will move pieces for next 10 minutes waiting for that one cop to find path around the corner. Hint 2: enemy's can trow bombs 3 blocks away, behind the corner...\n\nThere is no RPG aspect of game, 14 premade bosses and 50 gangsters that is all. (all of them are fantasy made and act so childish)\n-Want to create gangsters based on you or your desires... bad luck. No custom creation of any kind.\n-Would you like to have family/mob based on sex or ethnicity... bad luck. Soft cap of gangsters is 10 and with this soft cap you CANNOT filled following options.:\nCANNOT have Italian mafia nor Sicilian LCN\nCANNOT have Black Mob\nCANNOT have Irish Mob\nCANNOT Have Jewish Mob\nCANNOT Have Asian Mob\nCANNOT Have Latin based Organized Crime family\nCANNOT Have Female Mob\nBut you can have, circus of mobsters and for some reason in the middle of your game, 95% of time, your gangsters decide that they must fall in love with crew member and for some reason the same sex escapades are much more recurring that straight. Funny how nature do that. \nGangsters skills or Boss empire skills dont matter as there are so low % that only thing that matter is how much health they have and how big the accuracy bar is.\n-A few boxes for loot, but only one that you will ever use; will be weapons one and maybe the Armour one if you solo, others are there just for decorations, which they dont show on your player, when they are equipped.\n\nI could go on and on what is wrong with this game, but its not worth it. \"\"\"Developers\"\"\" were more preoccupied to make some kind of social statement, than actually make game, working game that is (Buggs everywhere).

I ran into pretty major bugs in a couple of the bosses story lines, for example I just could not continue the quest I was on as interacting with my desk to make a phone call would ring but nothing would prompt or continue the quest. I could not complete the main story quest for that boss due to this bug. \n\nI don't even think I can complete this run due to a bug. One of the safe houses for one of the main gangs was taken over by a rival gang, however, it is still labeled as the original gangs safe house... I have taken over every single racket owned by that gang but their safe house is owned by someone else. \n\nCombat feels good, very similar to XCOM, however the boss fights felt absolutely one sided and almost impossible. I could wipe out any other building without taking damage but as soon as I touched a safe house it felt impossible. I tried allying with other gangs and marked the building, 30 minutes into the war they never sent a squad to help.

I wish that when you his auto resolve or at least when your guards are involved in a fight that they would be controlled by AI. I am a player who enjoyed watching my minions and goons make their own moves as if they actually work for me. When i have to make each individual action for each minion I control it takes away from the \"Boss\" feeling for me... heck maybe even make it optional in the menu at least. oh an not too mention that when I select healing items it will sometimes select a random member who has full health instead of the character you are using...\n\n3.

I want the enemy and even my allies to feel something when they see their buddy they was having a chat with moments ago sprawled in bits and chunks in different places... or with their throat sliced can cause fear depending on a trait idk...\n\nBottom line...

You either in the menus micromanaging your rackets or gangsters. It would be much better to beautify your gangsters. Would be better to change their appearance.\n\n+ Cudo for complex diplomacy...\n- but it is broken. Too much penalty for turned down offers and AI spam you with offers. Enemies become best friends after truce and turn on their allies. It is getting chaotic too fast.\n- Moles needs a lot of time to complete their mission and the outcome doesn't worth the amount of salary you paying them during that time. You loose them for the time of the mission and still paying their salary.\n\n+ Bosses have different backstories. Well written and historically accurate!\n- Some of the bosses have OP ability. They can solo anything from the start.\n- Normal quests are repetitive not much randomness.\n- Choices are not really matter in game. Even in dialogues you always end up the same outcome except skill checks.\n+I like though that skills checks has no RNG element.\n\n+The gangsters reworked in last patch giving them more uniqueness...\n- but it completely ruined a lot of them. Some of them has wrong ability allocation. Or their choice don't match their traits. Or they have unique weapons but their abilities don't match that weapon choice.\n\n+Even gangsters have small story quests.\n- Some of these quests broke the gangster awarding a bad trait no matter what.\n- Most gangsters don't worth their salary and/or upfront fee.\n\nI give this my recommendation as it keeps me interested and perhaps with future improvements getting better.

The game does not take a toll on the computer despite appearances. Of course this varies for each computer, so tweaking the settings will be required.\n\nHowever, for some criticism, I found the voice acting solid but not superb. The game play is basic but intriguing. Currently, I am playing in the story of Goldie Garneau, a French woman from Montreal and found her accent to waver. Nonetheless, the character is waifu material and her story is still engaging. Once again like Omerta, Empire of Sin is very identical in theme and game play. I would say this game is great for those looking for a single player campaign where you can relax with snacks.

A few of my guys scatter to cover spots, but most of them stay right by the door. The guards now seem to have higher initiative than 80% of my team.

Unless you are bored or super curious, wait another 6 months.\n\nGame is passable but needs more improvement. Has the potential to be a lot better: key issue is to remove the tedious repetitiveness after a few hours.\n\nSome suggestions / weaknesses at the moment:\n\n- Need more ways to make money. The current way is to either go to war with another gang, take over their racket; or create a new racket from scratch by seizing an abandoned building (more or less the same thing). This gets repetitive. There should be a way to, for example, raid rackets of other gangs (without automatically starting a war), rob a store, and collect passive protection money. \n- The economy and $ values are a bit nonsensical. I could buy a crow bar or other melee weapon for approx 7,000. It costs less to open a new business, or even hire someone. Gangs will offer to pay you protection money of $70 a week. Why bother. It also feels like income from rackets is a bit low.\n- Combat: Not bad, but not exactly Xcom. A few things scream out to me: melee seems far too inaccurate to be useful and guns are too accurate. Some of the physics is crazy; I am shooting people with 90% accuracy across impossible angles, but i have less than 50% accuracy when trying to punch someone in the face at point blank range? Executing people seems to have no benefit at all.\n- to break up the monotony, they should have some combat missions to be timed (similar to xcom). Eg rob a bank and get out in less than 6 moves. \n- fewer gangs so defeating someone feels meaningful.\n- The grappling hook is immersion breaking and should be scrapped immediately. It also allows you to drag people through walls, which is absurd.\n- diplomacy: While at war, the only option is to seek a truce. If I am winning by a lot, I should be able to force a concession on my opinion (money, territory) on the loser (just copy the concept from other paradox games).\n- lieutenants: you shouldn't lose a combatant for appointing one\n-encountered a few bugs. Eg at war with someone but impossible to initiate combat, or it says I have lost a battle when in fact I have won.\n- automate explore function for gang members. AI does this, but human cant\n- right now one ends up spending too much time on combat, but combat is fairly boring.

There's something there to build on, but currently the game is quite shallow and bizarrely balanced. Bad economy design, bad strategic UI. Combat is \"ok\" but some bosses are so incredibly powerful off the bat that they trivialise 95% of the fights you encounter.\n\nThe default game settings has 10 districts with ~20-40 potential rackets in each, where there are only 4 varieties to build from. It gets tedious and overwhelming very quickly. It doesn't help that they don't have anything to interact with to help make them stand out. There's no reason to even visit them once you have them. Much like your own safehouses.\n\nManagement/Empire UI is poorly thought out. Having so many gangs, including small mobs, but only being able to scroll through them one by one, without a list or search is again tedious. Minor factions don't even have unique portraits, they are all the same and blend together. Not being able to go to diplomacy or info pages on a faction straight from the map, or even by clicking on their portraits in other menus also seems like a glaring oversight.\n\nGame economy is really unbalanced. There's no real reason to bother upgrading your rackets apart from alcohol quality in breweries. Firstly because there are so many of them that it's just not feasible to cover the costs, but also because the costs are so high compared to the income each racket generates that the ROI is terrible. Negotiating \"business proposals\" with other factions for 2-4% discount buffs is almost useless considering the drama it seems to cause.\n\nIt's more profitable to just mask cheap booze as whisky and sell it to factions. Also just selling whisky outright to minor factions is a faster way to make money than relying on your rackets. Item costs and sales prices, and the way your relationship score changes from trades is easily abused and mostly nonsensical. The cache drops across the maps at the start of the game allow you to decently kit out your entire gang before you even start a war, if you want to bother running around everywhere for 30 minutes. Gear seems to hit a peak relatively early as well, so you quickly run out of upgrade opportunities.\n\nThe enemy factions also appear to struggle with the game economy, as they tend to constantly be almost broke and as such barely upgrade anything apart from their own safehouse security. Which means you can just declare war and blitz everything they have without much fuss. The only \"challenge\" is that there can be so much happening across so many districts that you can't keep up with any roaming gangs on the streets to cut them off before they attack your own rackets. Even that's not a big deal, as savvy players will just pause the game and rush security upgrades as needed before the building is stormed.\n\nLieutenants, underbosses, moles etc all seem like cool ideas that never got past the first cycle of workshopping. You can't even use lieutenants again without \"demoting\" them and losing morale. There just doesn't seem to be much benefit of making new safehouses and paying to keep someone locked in there for the rest of the game, when you could keep them in your party and use the extra muscle to take down all the other factions faster.\n\nThe story and side missions are all fine, nothing outstanding. It seems you generally receive the best outcomes by showing mercy or \"being good\" at every opportunity, which is a bit odd for a hard boiled gangster-themed game with a cast of sociopaths.\n\nI haven't experienced any particularly big bugs, so at least recent patches appear to have stabilised the game considerably.\n\nAll in all I want to like this game a lot more than I currently do. It needs more flavour and more balance. I was holding off on getting it for a long time but finally caved.

I have beaten it on two different bosses and have not had any crashes.  Combat is Xcom like but I would call it Xcom like.  Yes combat is turn bases but in Xcom you make a mistake and will dearly pay for it, Empire of Sin I feel like is better (for me) as it doesn't punish you hard for making a tactical mistake.\n\nThe tycoon aspect of it is fun trying to take over neighborhoods and the story of each character is unique with many side quests.  Also there are different arcs for the bosses so just when you think your boss's story is over the one person you spared may come back and be a friend or foe. \n\nAuto resolve is coming in the next patch which is nice because there is nothing worse than having one enemy boss left and spending 30 minutes battling out in them attacking your brewery when you are just about to attack their safe house.

You don't really have the care for your random gangsters like you do the soldiers when they are cut down.  \n\nWhat Empire of Sin does right is the look.  The game setting looks good, the concept of a open world meets XCOM style turn based game is very unique, and playing the mob boss from a more strategic level is neat.  The police and feds as a third faction that comes out of nowehere seemingly to ruin your day is a nice touch and the in game missions aren't bad either. \n\nThat said it has some odd hang ups that prevent it from being a cult classic.\n\n-unlike other paradox games where historical accuracy is aimed for and alternative history is played up for a joke this game really mixes things up.  Example Hymie Weiss, the man alleged to be the only man Al Capone feared is someone you can just hire off bat.  \n-the gangs are very inclusive and open minded despite what history says, I wouldn't mind this if they did it like CK3 where I have options to play historical or non historical but a lot of these gangs won't even allow you to be in them unless you're of a certain ethnicity or race unless you're the bottom level guys\n-There's some sort of relationship system between your henchmen which is mostly just annoying.  I get the concept was some henchmen would not attack each other but mostly it comes off as strange.  Seemingly ALL my henches are bisexual evidently and I've had such strange parings as the black and proud harlem hellfighter and the refuses to be reconstructed ex confederate solider. I mean being gay in the era is wild enough much less the age and race issues going on in that relationship.  But it seems to happen with EVERYONE.  Everybody is just itching to get into some sort of sexual relationships seemingly just as an annoying game mechanic which is all it becomes in the end.  \n-Oddly enough the mechanic as progressive and ahistorical as it is, it also hinges entirely off mongamy.  Evidently all my bisexual gangsters refuse to share with anyone.  We run brothels, they're all bi, but no one wants to share or even consider a orgy.  So instead I have to keep my drama queens apart or my XCOM game becomes a slap fight between my crew except with guns.  It's beyond pathetic and really makes me feel like Al Capone should have been questioning his actions long before he had the mayor of Chicago murdered. \n-Honestly all the business management seems really secondary to the turn based fighting.  It's what earns you the money for vests, guns, etc but your best gear comes from other crime bosses which you get by killing them so really the money is just to buy better bisexual hench persons. \n-Oddly about every race is in this game minus hindus, arabs, and islander types...there are two full blooded indigenous Americans as well which can only seem so progressive about a game centered around illegal alcohol trade. Again it's an attempt to be progressive but at what end if you're also trying to be historical?  Henry Hill wasn't exaggerating about the whole not being full blooded Italian means you can't be made, ironically crime is not that open minded about race in fact they're the opposite but won't let it stop them making a buck.  \n-The rival gangs are mostly made up which I can somewhat understand but all the legit organizations should be in game.\n-All organizations cops, gangs, etc have females in them.  Again I get the progressive tone but it makes the game look more like Michael Jackson's \"Smooth Criminal\" because they all wear the men's attire regardless.  Only female henchmen, gangbosses, and prostitutes can dress like women.  The 20s must have been a strange time with bisexual criminals who are only into monogamy but have very odd dress code rules.  \n\nOverall it needs work and I think a historical option playing up the more edgy less progressive aspects of the organizations would be interesting as well.

On top of that, the AI is bad strategically as well.

Lastly, the \"ambush\" mechanic is just broken. Especially since the AI can't use it on you. As an ambush works now, you can literally position all of your guys one square away and have them all trained to shoot at first movement. I get being able to set up your guys if the enemy doesn't see it coming, but there has to be a risk that they will see it and react, not just let you set up where and how you want without any fear even right on top of them.\n\nThis is a bad game and Paradox should feel bad.

Unfortunately there is no way to make group commands. So once you have a good number you will spend allot of time cycling through every business checking it's upgrades and shutting it down or opening it back up.\n\nPacing: The core game play loop is attack a place, loot/retrofit the place, rest/recuperate/re-arm your team. With the occasional attack against you to defend against. Unfortunately the loop quickly breaks. First once you level up a few characters they become game breaking to the point of being able to win fights on turn one. Second while the is some diversity in enemies, there isn't quit enough so they become repetitive, especially since many of the maps will be repeated as well. Third it's all pointless, there is no point in attacking individual enemy buildings, it doesn't weaken them, and aside from the experience grind, you just gain one building, but if you just attack the enemy headquarters(and win) you get all their holdings at once. So eventually the core game play loop becomes a pointless repetitive grind that you're better off skipping.\n\nNote:\nThe game does have a variety of bugs, but they're not too much of a problem.

The game isn't as terrible as I heard. The graphics and music is nice and it creates a nice atmosphere. If you're a person who just want to kill a few hours or do one play through it's probably somewhat enjoyable. The biggest flaw is the end game. But I believe the game can become so much more in the future and I hope they continue to improve it! \n\nFLAWS:\nAfter I've killed 2 bosses I see no point to continue playing it. Sure I can get more money, to max every racket. But why should I do that when I'm already snowballing? The questline expands to \"get 50, 100 rackets\" and again.. why? You get rewarded more money from those quest. At this point I was already maxed out in notoriety which means I can hire whom ever i want. So.. now I'm not only overpowered but my crew is as well, when I only killed 2 other families..\n\nNothing new happens, it just becomes an eternal grind, which isn't very fun, challenging or engaging. \n\nI've started over many times. The start is the most fun and engaging part in all aspects, quests, story and quite challenging.\nThe more you get into the mid/endgame you loose the \"we/us\" mentality for your family. I get to overpowered or money just comes to easy and there's really no motivation for me to continue. \n\nMore story quests would help this game a lot, more cinematic's, make it harder to find the enemies safe houses or that you need to kill advisers/under bosses to progress ending another faction. Then something needs to be added to the endgame why I should grind it out and kill all the other families. \n\nPolice:\nThe police needs rework. None of my gangsters have gotten arrested (on 3 different saves). \nWhen the police raid your rackets (which rarely happens), you pay them 1000 and they're gone. \nThey should be able to shut down your operation/rackets. I'm not even giving a single thought about them. They should be a faction to fear, \"If I start another war right now, I also will have the police on my ass, is it worth it?\" \nRight now they're just there, not doing much. \nIf you get into an altercation with them it's usually by accident, they just happened to be walking on the street and get caught between the crossfire when you attack or defend a racket. But there's no worry, if you kill them your wanted reputation drops??\n\nConclusion: \nIt's not the best game in the world, it's not the worst it's something right in between.\n\nAs a person who loved the Godfather games you will probably agree with me that the story were a big factor why you continued to kill off the other families, that's the biggest flaw IMO. There's no real motivator why you should finish them off you only get more money and rackets when there's no need, cause I'm already fully geared. \n\nI have very high hopes and the game got potential but it needs much more work. \n\nIn the end it just get's very repetitive.

I thought this was going to be almost 1:1 with XCOM games. Just set in an old timey gangster era. I was totally wrong about that.

Diplomacy is a bit of a mess. Just not even sure whats going on with it half of the time. There are way too many female mobsters. The female named characters are fine. But theres no way 50% of a crew was women in the 30's. I also can't get my head around how a gang with less power than me can hit 6 of my places on the same turn. its just a drag fighting out those 2v3 battles. and half of the time theres a  cop in the area so theres no way to win and not piss off the cops. HOWEVER. They have announced mods. Depending on what the modders are able to accomplish i would say most of those gripes will be addressable.

Either the devs are lazy, uncommitted or this game isn't ready for release. \n\nNow lets look at what makes the game frustrating to play:\n\n1. The combat.  For XCOM style combat, you would think people in the 20s all have polio. The AP distance for running is appalling, and I think this choice was made to draw out combat or because the AI was too easily flanked. The effect however is it makes combat unsatisfying as you crawl towards your enemy 6 tiles at a time, having no choice but to take hits simply to advance. A proper development route would be upgrade your AI, not hobble the player. Finally, you have no time to setup or plan attacks, you can take very few strategic decisions. Flanking is difficult because of the run distance, your best option is just to (boringly) blaze away from static positions while the AI runs up to you. Yes that's right, if you stay in one place, the AI just runs at you, sometimes not even bothering with cover, until they are mowed down. \n\n2. I could live with the map mode but there is no solidity or robustness to the UI. None of the menus or charts are interactive or interesting. I frequently have problems trying to actually upgrade my establishments, as the menu to do so it inexplicably buried within other menus, which do nothing. Similarly, the weapons shop stupidly has a $20,000 gun in it the moment you start the game, and for the first 2-4 hours, not very much else. What is that - something to aim for? I think it was put in there because the devs were embarrassed about lack of early content, personally.\n\n3.  The characters are good, the missions ok, but there is very little strategic feel right now.\n\nI await the expansions. I think the first one shoud be free as an apology for the terrible combat.

Instead, you have a hodgepodge of feel-good, Disney-gangsters whose interaction amongst each other is offensively anachronistic and entirely sanitized. You cannot fix the mistakes of the past if you do not acknowledge them.\n\nThe worst offender is the most prestigious gangster you can hire, an androgynous mystery named \"R\". \n\nGood luck with \"R\" not getting mocked or worse in the 20s and 40s underworld; it was an ugly time and if you're aiming for any semblance of realism, this sticks out like a sore thumb. This does a disservice to the nastiness of the criminal underworld they claim to try and replicate, and hurts the already mediocre game even more. \n\nI desperately wanted to like this game.

Admittedly I haven't played since the first couple of weeks after launch, but at the time my thoughts were that this was a really great concept of a game and I enjoyed my time with it, but unless Paradox kept up with this game like they do with their other content then I'd have to say it's a pass for those not already enticed by just the genre and setting alone. After reading through the most recent patch notes, it appears Paradox is listening and actively working to make this another potential flagship game for them by fixing bugs and adjusting elements of the game that were very broken at launch. I look forward to picking this back up when my work slows down in April and seeing these patch notes in reality. \n\nI had to move back in with my parents because of the quarantine, but having this game set in Chicago has been awesome for me because it sort of let me revisit my old neighborhood while still learning more about the history of those roaring 20's. There's a lot more that was going on that just Al Capone and it's fun to play through that.\n\nI hope the Devs stay active and keep building on this great idea for a game. I know the PAradox way usually includes a lot of DLC, but that DLC is often worth the price especially if it's on sale at some point if we use EU4 as an example.

So.  Mother.  === F = U = C = K = I = N = G ===  Many. Bugs.  GAME-BREAKING BUGS. Did they even Beta this game?  I don't understand.  This is NOT ready for primetime, not by a long shot.  Whatever project manager had the bright idea to go ahead and put this up on Steam for $39.99 should be fired.  I get schedule pressure and commit dates and the like, I live and breathe that world...BUT ... Schedule is not more important than finishing the product, dumbass! \n\nI've had combat encounters start with 5x the enemies because the game would glitch and wouldn't accept my 'attack this racket' command.  I've had combat not end because a body would keep ragdolling.  I've had my boss Al Capone just repeat his 'sit down in a chair' animation on an infinite loop in the middle of a street with no chair - he is just floating there, unable to do jack shit else, only to teleport back to a standing position to sit down all over again.  I've had combat start.......only to have everybody just kinda....stand there.  I left my computer sitting like that for HOURS (overnight) before to see if time would help, nope.  I've had my gangsters think a really........longg........tiiime......before they take their action on their turn.  I have a glitch where the mouse will just ..barely..move...off..the..center..of..the..screen... until I alt-tab away.  Only to come right back to that glitch after one right mouse click.  Rinse and repeat.\n\nSome bugs are so bad that I have to kill the whole .exe just to get anything at all to happen.  This all completely ruins the immersion and it's hard to want to stick with it when I have to wipe the game's ass all the time.  Thank God I haven't run into the save-destroying nightmares some other commenters have.  I would just ask for my money back at that point.  Regardless, I've put in 38 hours so far, because for the 5 minute stretches when you don't have to bust out the baby wipes and the Huggies it is pretty enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay elements are pretty fun and I hope the devs get the chance they need to polish the shit off of this thing, because it could be a pretty cool experience.

I very much like a lot of different aspects of what I've seen so far - the aesthetic, the characters, the complex interplay of different nefarious mobster shenanigans and Chicagonomics, plus the slightly pseudo-RPG aspect of having a storyline for each boss as they progress through the campaign.  There have been a few attempts at this sort of game over the years, and this looks to be potentially as strong a contender as any.\n\nThat said, having read much of the feedback from other players who've spent more time getting further into the game, it sounds like there's still quite a lot which needs tweaking, gameplay balance aspects to sort out and things which could be deeper and more varied.  So... in the most on-the-developers'-side way possible, it's going to be on the shelf for now.

A fresh take on XCOM strategy (although a bit too much of an XCOM copy-pasta but that's even another subject).\n\nNow onto the part that'll make you angry...\nHere are some things from the top of my head after finishing one playthrough, eliminating 9 other gangs, in 14 hours :\n\n- Characters regularly bug and take 10 seconds to make a single shot. As you are repeatedly firing, you find yourself just waiting around very often.\n- Enemies sometimes go out of bounds and the game crashes.\n- The combat AI is plain trash. Enemies will walk and stop in front of you without cover. They'll sometimes pass their turn without firing when they have you actually pinned down. They'll go back and forth, use the wrong gun, or fire shotguns from the other side of the map. Total mess.\n- On a related point, the game is completely unbalanced. On normal difficulty, *I wasn't attacked once*. I just STOMPED over every single gang Chicago had to offer. At the end of the game, the breweries I captured to the AI were still producing swill, the first of five levels of alcohols you can upgrade. Evidently the fucked up combat AI doesn't help here and makes it very easy to exploit the AI and win pretty much every fight easily.\n- The \"hair trigger\" skill is either bugged or completely unbalanced. When a gangster goes insane because of this skill, he will fire long bursts at every enemy he can see. When it's a gangster that knows how to handle a gun you will often see 4 or 5 enemies be killed just by him, with a tommy gun from the other side of the map. This simply turned the tables on some relatively challenging boss fights, that were won just by this.\n- Sound bugs are popping regularly and some sounds are poorly mixed. Some gangsters have a much higher volume on their voice.\n- Quests are buggy, I couldn't finish some of them, scripts would simply not trigger at some point.\n- Also the mistakes with the XCOM interface were kept without improvement.\nAnd don't get me started on little details like the UI that is often wrong (a price is shown but it's actually another, the status icons over enemies heads remain even when they are dead, or poor UI choices like these status menus that go up and down automatically when they're bigger than the screen, or the mousewheel that doesn't work on the EFFING LONG lists of rackets you have at the end of the game...).\n\nIt's late and I didn't write down everything I saw so I'm missing a lot here.\nAnyway, right now it's just a mess.\n\nBUT, a playable mess. So if you really love XCOM and want some more of it, go ahead. Just know where you're stepping.\nOh and a last thing. Don't play normal difficulty if you're an XCOM veteran, and if you do choose a high difficulty, don't choose more than 6 or 7 enemy factions if you don't want one playthrough to take you 40 hours (which you don't want because there's a lot of repetitive fighting and mechanics).\n\nFor me, I'm out and may be back in a year when the DLC's are available and if they have seriously worked on all this stuff.", "timestamp_created": 1611805817, "timestamp_updated": 1611805817, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570842266082763672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "85473875": {"recommendationid": "85473875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847239721", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 325, "playtime_at_review": 1247, "last_played": 1619116482}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely one of the best games I ever played, you must think smart, quick and decisive at the same moment..it has all the elements of \"Civilization Game Series\" plus it has the touch of Mafia series and then you have also the nice graphics...really nice, definitely recommending it to anyone who wants to try a new game", "timestamp_created": 1611799804, "timestamp_updated": 1611799804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463576167821884155", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "85442616": {"recommendationid": "85442616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049034492", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1607038135}, "language": "english", "review": "What's more worrying than how buggy the game is how the developer has gone silent.

You're also forced to manage the defenses of your own property when an enemy gang decides to invade you, which can feel frustrating if you don't have one of your tougher underlings stationed nearby. The generic units you get and face in the property defense feels boring and more of a numbers game, which further unnecessarily extends the length of the fight.\n\nProperty Management: The concept feels pretty ok, but I don't think I've been able to generate enough money off the property and have been spending more time raiding and invading. Although I've only had a short time playing it, the upgrades don't feel impactful for the defenses and the payout isn't noticable in the long term for profits. Also there's a constant change in the areas that can affect the amount you can make, which is to deter you from monopolizing on a single product line.\n\nThey have posted that they created a community group to gather feedback and directly influence the development, but I am still waiting to see something that changes to jump out at me. I'm sure that alot of people are enjoying what it has to offer, but it doesn't really make much of a good impression for me, and feels more like an early access game.\n\nIf i had to give it a rating: 3/5\nThere are some interesting concepts that they want to do but it needs further fleshing out to make gameplay more interesting and less of a chore for certain core mechanics.

It's not even worth it in the end.\n\nIt looks like it's a management game (maybe i fooled myself by thinking that) and that there's a business (mafia) you run. Better the business, more powerful you get. I was even more suprised to see in the trailer that there were dialog options and I was like \"THERE'S EVEN AN RPG TYPE ELEMENT?\" and no, there wasn't. It's not a management game + some combat, it's a combat game (and waaaaaay too repetitive, XCOM at least has a cool plot about ALIENS INVADING EARTH, cutscenes, characters you can customize and feel so bad that when they die you revert to a save because you care about them etc. this one just has different weapons that you only care about because of their stats and mercenaries that you can hire and don't really care about because when you care about them some dumb bug happens and ruins everything. im just ranting at this point) + something that looks like management but it really isn't, it's just an illusion.\n\ni suggest buying this in 2021 or something (that is if they start fixing this \"thing\" and bring some good things).\n\nP.S.

It has the same combat style i love from XCOM and such, with different classes bringing different ways to play encounters. It alsohas the management side of the coin, bringing somewhat intresting combinations of rackets you can stack up for different and better bonuses, all the while choosing who to assign to each different neighbourhood to boost its capabilities.\n\nAll of this and i still wouldnt suggest it to a friend.\nThe game SUPPOSEDLY has an AUTOSAVE feature. It's shit. Plain and simple. In nearly 15 hours of game i have seen it work TWO times, while it also takes a few seconds to save. The autosaves are WAAAAAAY to far and few for the amount of times the game crashes.\nI'm fairly sure i've lost ATLEAST a third of the progress i made in those near 15 hours due to random crashes/softlocks: the game will engage you in a fight and magically it soflocks, nothing you can do. Captured a racket? the game might softlock. Ambushing someone? game might softlock. Entering a racket you own? 1/5 chance it softlocks. playing your combat round? guess what, it probably will softlock every few hours or so.\n\nThere is nothing you can do. There are a thousand instances in which the game might softlock that will screw you over ROYALLY, expecially considering the game probably autosaves once every few hours. And SPOILER, you cant save when the game softlocks.\n\nRight now, i would just suggest waiting a few months for the DEVS to patch the game, atleast reducing the times it crashes/softlocks and having autosaves 10x times.

I personally think its pretty cool to watch the neighborhoods fold and change and im right there in it. If i had more time and less job i could see myself running this game in different scenarios all the time. Im having fun with it. Is it anywhere near as polished as others in the genre? Absolutely not. But its a bit of a new approach to the genre if you ask me and i enjoy it. Totally different feel than Xcom which its constantly compared to. Not to mention xcom has had lots of time to mature with multiple installments and paid DLC along the way.   To compare the two when this game is basically an infant in comparision is unfair imo. Overall a solid 7.5/10 for me as the game is now. With updates and patches on AI (which im sure is priority one over there with how much its mentioned in reviews) and just some overall bug fixes, throw in some cool stuff and perhaps some sort of fast match multiplayer where players can fight over a neighborhood or whatever (can be done on quick small fast game scale) or make it a huge sim like single player with a few live factions (or all) and this game would honestly be a 10/10 game for me i can see going back to for years.\n\nThanks EOS Team", "timestamp_created": 1609843431, "timestamp_updated": 1609843431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546218514442443848", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "84042685": {"recommendationid": "84042685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198912447822", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 1999, "last_played": 1618551159}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I have play in a long time.

This is due to the fact that this game combines XCOM like combat with Civilization like diplomacy all set in 1920s Chicago. However, This game simply falls short in every way imaginable. To start, this game masquerades itself as a strategy game, but there is really no strategy involved whatsoever. Even as I played on the hardest difficulty, I just cut through enemy factions like butter, and I didn\u2019t even have to use most of the \u201cstrategic\u201d game mechanics. Unlike the Civilization series, you really only have alcohol and money to use in trading and diplomacy, which makes the game feel shallow and makes replaying the game boring and repetitive. Even if the game included more resources and things to trade, it wouldn\u2019t matter because the only win condition is that you kill all of the other faction leaders, which makes diplomacy completely irrelevant. The level design is mediocre at best and the combat is extremely boring and tedious, which makes warring against enemy factions redundant as the game forces you to fight every individual battle. For a 1920s Mafia game, the world lacks any realism, factions do not recruit crewmates within their nationality and ethnicity, and women make up half of the bosses and crewmates. I realize that in our current world everyone is accepted regardless of race or gender, but this makes a game set in the 1920s not really feel immersive. In its current state the game is riddled with bugs and a lot of them are game breaking ones. On top of all of this, the games released at $39.99, which is a horrendous price for a game that maybe has 10 to 20 hours of content tops. Not to mention that Paradox will likely release countless DLCs to fix and add elements to the game that should have been there in the base game.

The Jazz soundtrack fits the timeperiod and both the battle and background music is fitting.\n\nThe Bosses - All of the bosses are unique in a way or another. All are very strong, bordering on overpowered.\n\nThe Items - There are a lot of different weapons in this game, all with different stats.\n\nThe Neutral\n\nGameplay - The gameplay is hit or miss. Boss battles are fun, but 95% of all fights are with either random thugs or guards. The gameplay is fun, but it gets repetitive after fighting 2 or 3 thugs for the 200th time\n\nManagement - The Management aspect of the game is very basic. There are only 4 types of Outlets to own and all 4 feel similar to each other. Both the Speakeasy and Brothel buildings act completely the same, with Casinos being a little bit of a difference. The only one that is completely unique is the Brewery. \n\nThe Bad\n\nBugs - This game is full of bugs. From animation glitches to not selecting the correct target and a really annoying glitch that happened when ambushing, which required to load an earlier save. \n\nNotification Spam - The game spams you with different notifications. Most of the time the notifications are meaningless like the events happening on the other side of the city.\n\nDifficulty - XCOM games are very difficult, but this game is every easy. I played the game on Underboss difficulty and it wasn't difficult.\n\nExploits - Even tho they patched the exploit where you could sell huge amounts of swill for whiskey to a minor faction, the game has a lot of exploits. You can exploit the Weapon stashes for better weapons and equipment, boss abilities can win the game with ease and many more.\n\nReplayability - The game is a semi roguelike, but the replayability for the game is terrible. There isn't some special objective for each Boss to win the game. For every boss you need to kill every single boss in the game and that's it. There isn't some special mission for each Boss that you need to do. Also the map is the same every time. If you could change your city to some other notorious cities of the time period, then maybe this could work.\n\nOverall \n\nOverall this is an OK, but very flawed game. Despite the many shortcomings, the game was enjoyable, but I can't recommend getting the game unless it's on Sale. Overall a 6/10.

I love Paradox Interactive, I think they're a fantastic studio/publisher. They've got some of my favorite games under their belt (Surviving Mars/Aftermath, Stellaris, etc), and I like the setting, music, and ambiance. \n\nThe primary problem, in my opinion, comes from the game play. It's part of the core game play loop so I'm not sure if or how it could be fixed. The combat in this game is the turn based, grid based, isometric style any X-Com player would recognize. It is significantly simpler than X-Com2, which came out almost 5 years ago.  It gets repetitive, quickly, and there is a lot of it. Oh boy is there a lot of it. Seems like, with few exceptions when you're focusing on base building for a few minutes, there is a generated fight every 5 minutes or so. The maps get repetitive (you'll see repeats within the first 5 fights), it's basically the same 3-5 bad guy set up each time. It just is too much of the same thing. \n\nI would have liked to see this game focus a greater emphasis on base building / empire management. I'm sure the world opens up more as you progress. I've got 9 hours logged on the game in two playthroughs (I restarted after realizing it wasn't a great idea to pick a fight with Capone as a newbie, but the combat is easy enough where you think it might be.) \n\nI don't know, I want to like this game. It's got great flavor and the world building based on characters' backstories slowing coming out through interactions with other bosses is an interesting set up. It's just that you see that combat screen way too frequently for how simplistic the fighting actually is. Hopefully the fighting gets more complex, or the frequency gets turned down, but I cannot recommend this game in it's current state.

It's got some great concepts at its core, and cool ideas, but in its current state it completely fails to be a good gaming experience.\n\nEmpire of Sin looks like it started as an ode to mafia strategy games like Gangsters: Organized Crime, but quickly got taken over by X-Com. That actually seemed appealing at first, but the two genres never really seem to mesh. Your criminal empire is made up of various \"rackets\" that generate different amounts of cash depending on various upgrades. There's a deep menu explaining the desires of each ward in the city, and how well the rackets are fulfilling those needs. There are bonuses for adjacency. There are special Hotel rackets that don't generate much income, but do generate more demand. There's a system of prosperity in the wards that changes what people in those wards want at different times in the game.\n\nNone of that matters. None of it. There are just tons and tons of systems built for a Mafia strategy game that just simply don't matter at all to your success. The real game is in the turn-based combat. Using just a few men, you can easily take over most enemy rackets as they only start with 2 guards, and upgrading security is expensive, and takes a while. That means that most combat is a breeze, and by the mid-game you'll be dominating almost all battles.\n\nWhen you get to a certain point you'll be able to reliably take down enemy safe houses, which are the only challenging battles in the game. Once that happens, the game is just a few battles from being over, as taking out an enemy safe house nets you their entire empire all at once. That just makes the game feel like it could have been re-tooled to be a story-driven turn-based squad combat game, and strip out the totally unnecessary strategy sim. \n\nI don't know how to fix this. Maybe it's just core balance issues. Maybe Rackets need to start with more defenses by default so you can't just plough your way through the game with combat, but as it stands right now the game doesn't \"work\".\n\nThat being said, I see a lot of complaints about bugs, and I only ran into one bug while playing, and it was fairly minor (a character always appeared to be dead, but functioned properly otherwise).

The combat is repetitive but still fun for me after @40 hours. The faction AI is solid and can be very punishing if you start a war before you're well prepared. Resource management is pretty good, although some additional nuance and complexity would be nice. There are numerous quests that pop up during play and these are fun. Many of them are tied to the particular gangsters you've hired, so there's good motivation to try out different people. Gangster relationships remind me fondly of Jagged Alliance 2, another of my all-time favorites. The city looks great and has a lot of wonderful immersive touches. \n\nRoom for improvement? Sure. Playing on default difficulty the police/feds seemed like non-factors and the dynamic mini-factions -- while cool additions that make the city feel more alive -- feel easy to exploit to get ahead of the other major factions. Another exploit-y thing is fast travel (done via taxi) which allows you to respond too quickly to enemy attacks, thus nullifying their danger to a large degree.

While a bit shallow with only five rackets, three cash builders, a supplier and a synergy multiplier, it can get repetitive doing the same thing to gain more capital but in saying that I still enjoy it as you take over more businesses you gain control over the neighbourhood and as it becomes more prosperous the people want fancier alcohol which gains you more cash to expand the empire. Which leads to combat as your rivals aren't going to let you take their businesses lying down, it can be quick and brutal especially for your side if you leave you men out of cover but the downside to it is some characters have quite overpowered abilities which can easily turn the battle heavily in your favour, plus the AI aren't the smartest often running straight towards your men who but that point can be sitting in overwatch waiting for one man to run in their cone of vision and be gunned down by your up to ten (I think) man squad. The management AI isn't much better as I was able to get all their unique weapons by trading a bunch of common weapons up to the same value level and some quests can glitch leaving incompletable or doomed to fail.

Other bosses willing to team up with you more if you come from the same place as them or your personality match theirs. Which is what I saw in one youtube video on the game. \n\nGameplay wise I love it. You have these different abilities to play with from your boss\u2019s special ability to hinchmen\u2019s abilities. With pistols to machine guns. Semi-autos to fully automatic weapons. The people you hire can be formed up how you like them to play\n\nEach henchmen have different relationships with other characters. Which may cause them to leave if you shoot the people they love. Which happened to me once in the game. \n\nThe racket system is rather simple. You produce liquor for your speakeasy. Liquor to make your Casino visitors not be able to think. And you have hotels to bring people into your neighborhood to increase the amount of customers. If the customer\u2019s tastes in liquor change, you can change the production of your breweries. \n\nI love the naming feature as it's fun to name something you owned after taking it over or buying it. \n\nThere is diplomacy from trading to allying yourself with others against other bosses. I barely used it except for declaring war on everyone.\n\nThere were only a few issues I had with the game. Fast Travel was too easy to use since there are taxis all over the place. My run as Sai Wing Mock Usually involved me fast traveling and poison bombing the guards out of nowhere. \n\nAnother issue is that the boss' abilities are op. Sai Wing Mock\u2019s ability can allow you to throw three bombs which poison an area for the rest of the battle. I usually clear out most of the guards in the battles thanks to me having three bombs. This would be more balanced if Mock could only throw two bombs. \n\nThe third issue is that the unique items you get from the bosses are worth the risk of killing the bosses. Unique items pretty much turn your Zeros into Heros. I gave my mercs the unique items and they easily did their jobs well. It makes me wish the items could only be obtained through special side quests or could only be found in random locations. \n\nAnother issue is that the other bosses very little through the game use their abilities. The only boss I saw use theirs was Genna after I ended most of the other bosses. When he threw knives at my gang during my raid on his safe house. \n\nAnother issue I had with this was that you could beat this game with low tier mercs. The bosses only have one merc with them. With them usually being a medic. In the end I never got my hands on the best mercs and just swarmed the last bosses with low tier mercs carrying unique weapons.\n\nThere is one issue I have that is a single glitch. The first one and only one I encountered was that gangsters from other gangs stick around after their bosses are dead. I had an encounter with the Vice Kings long after their boss was dead. By this time I\u2019m pretty sure there was already a funeral for Jackson. \n\nIt didn\u2019t bother me much until I raided Colt\u2019s safe house. After I defeated the White Circus while they were at war with Colt. I got war declared on me by Colt. I went in and the White Circus had the last laugh. As the White Circus guards teamed up with Colt and his gang. Making it impossible for me to take over Colt\u2019s Safe house. So reloaded a save and waited for Dyer to kill Colt before I killed her.  \n\nAlso during the lieutenant mode, I spent little on my rackets and never got raided by the police. I wish the game rewarded you for spending time waiting for more money even though you are strong enough to end the other bosses careers.\n\nDespite the issues, this was a fun game to play. It's a lot easier compared to Paradox\u2019s other games like EU4 or HOI4. Though it could use a lot of additions to make the game a bit more complex then how it is. Which can be added over time with DLC.", "timestamp_created": 1609056985, "timestamp_updated": 1609056985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83257361": {"recommendationid": "83257361", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971414698", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 669, "last_played": 1607122604}, "language": "english", "review": "I was very much looking forward to this game but what a complete and utter failure.  The turn based combat could have been interesting and brutal but no it's the usual xcom rip off with hitpoints and special abilities which seem completely at odds with the theme - this isn't a fantasy RPG and yet it feels like Al Capone is 'casting' bullet storm.  I understand you might have one gangster who is good with a knife or a gun but the special abilities are ridiculous and rather than enhancing the game just force you to play the characters one way and one way only.  This all leads to rinse and repeat gameplay.  As Al Capone i used the same order of skills every fight.  Just tedious to the point where I wished I could skip the fights.\n\nThe diplomacy is laughable.  So and so wants a sit down.  Go through pretty much identical dialogue and do a deal which gives you a slight bonus or don't.  That's it.  Plus you can have another gangster assassinate all your rivals (with literally no effort) then kill your ally and you've won the game.  I'd understand if you achieved that end with skill and special deals etc, but no you literally just click a button multiple times.\n\nI have no idea why they opted for pre-made gangsters rather than random ones.  I thought with paradox involved there might have been more of this sort of thing with random/custom characters, but no it's one stupid cartoony gangster after another.  I'm all for being inclusive in a game but every other gangster is female, which is simply not the case. \nAnd seriously ooohh I've got a purple 1911 which has better stats - it's purile fluff.  The purpose of a gangster game one might think is about making money, avoiding prison, bribery and corruption and getting into turf wars with competitors.  These elements are all so bland in this game.\n\nSo what's good?  The map is cool and how you manage the business.  Except the economy and trade is broken so you can completely abuse that system.  And it sounds good that the police can raid your businesses etc, except I've not ever seen it happen.  Oh and despite having a nice map with civilians and cars etc you can just insta teleport when you need to which entirely defeats the purposes of having guards on your various businesses etc.\n\nI really tried to like this game and was really looking forward to it albeit with realistic expectations given the studio making it.  But this is just appalling.  If you wanted something resembling a prohibition era gangster/bootlegging game go play Gangsters Organised crime which though extremely old still is a deeper, more enjoyable experience.

Well, as it turns out, a lot of things, actually.\n\n[h2]Gameplay:[/h2]\nSo let\u2019s just start this off by saying that I\u2019m disappointed more than anything. This is a game with a fantastic concept, a game that could have been good. However, the execution is just shallow, nowhere near enough to really sell the experience.\n\nI have two major problems with Empire of Sin: its combat elements and its management elements. Considering that those are the two major areas to the game, we\u2019re already off to a bad start, but I\u2019ll talk about the combat first.\n\n[h2]Combat:[/h2]\nThis is a strategy game that has combat done in a turn-based tactics manner, similar to the XCOM series. You get your group of gangsters, enter a building, and have to eliminate all of the opposition to win. It\u2019s pretty simple, but the real experience lies in the depth of that combat. I will admit, my first couple hours with the game, I was actually satisfied. The combat was fun and I was having a good time going from building to building growing my empire.\n\nHowever, I quickly found out that there is really nothing beyond that. The combat does not really evolve, it kinda remains static throughout the entire game, whether you be 2 hours in or 20. Despite going into different buildings, you\u2019ll start to notice the exact same layouts, the same enemy types, the same weapons, and the same abilities used in every single fight. Sure, you unlock more abilities as your characters level up, but it\u2019s only like four or five until they\u2019ve maxed out, nowhere near enough to offer the combat depth required to avoid that feeling of monotony.\n\nDue to how simple it is, the combat eventually devolves into this repetitive sequence that you can apply to every single fight and win without issue. In fact, once I had a group of six or so gangsters, I pretty much steamrolled any competition. Whether it be a simple building takeover or a boss fight \u2013 they all felt the same and this alone honestly kills the overall experience.\n\n[h2]Management:[/h2]\nThere is another side to the game though through its management elements. And unfortunately, those management elements are equally lacking. I would go so far as to equate them to a clicker game, as all you\u2019re really doing is applying upgrades, switching which alcohol your establishments serve, and waiting for money to apply even more upgrades. There really is not much to do here, and it was so bad that at one point I was literally sitting there fiddling with my phone while I waited for money to come in so I could buy more upgrades so that the money would come in faster so that I could buy more upgrades and you can kinda see where this is going.\n\nHowever, all of that goes out the window when you realize that the entire management aspect is kinda pointless. Why spend time upgrading stuff or changing what alcohol your establishments are serving when you can simply waltz into an enemy safehouse, kill their boss, and acquire all of their buildings with just that one battle. Do this for each boss in the game and you\u2019ve won, without ever needing to really engage with any sort of management.\n\nReally, the most management you get is with your characters themselves. They each have their own skill tree, a bunch of different equipment slots, and even traits and relationships. For example, a character that is in love with another gangster will not attack them even if they are on the opposing side in a battle. And sometimes a character\u2019s loyalty to you will unlock gangsters for hire that would have otherwise been unavailable. Playing around with the characters was easily the best part of the management side to the game, but unfortunately the bulk of that side is managing your establishments \u2013 the boring part.\n\n[h2]Technical Issues:[/h2]\nDuring my time with the game, I ran into plenty of animation issues, clipping, and freezes during combat that would hang the game for seconds at a time. That and the AI is not the greatest either, oftentimes putting itself in really bad positions during combat or just acting in a manner that actively ruins their chances of winning. I was fortunate to not run into any crashes (the game has been patched up a bit since its rocky launch), but it\u2019s still not an entirely smooth experience.\n\n[h2]Overall:[/h2]\nI cannot recommend Empire of Sin. Patches may be able to fix the technical problems, but the core to the game is just far too shallow to be worth the time. Repetitive combat, lackluster management elements, it just loses its appeal after those initial few hours. A shame, as I really like the concept here, but the execution just doesn\u2019t cut it.\n\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews + videos!", "timestamp_created": 1608834732, "timestamp_updated": 1608834898, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 112, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780324697494506836", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83014064": {"recommendationid": "83014064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285396415", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 2835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1462, "last_played": 1611675507}, "language": "english", "review": "It's basically 1920s Prohibition XCOM, but shallower.

The problem is, it's buried beneath layers of flawed AI design and a plethora of still-unfixed bugs, among other things. The problem is that the developers shoved this out way too early. This game needed another few weeks or months of work before releasing, because this game has faults that no simple handful of bug fix patches are going to necessarily fix.\n\nPros:\n-The Prohibition-era aesthetic is one that's rarely explored in videogame form, and from a historical angle, this game is a pretty accurate (if obviously exaggerated) depiction of said era.\n-The visual quality is impeccable, no complaints there, especially during mob boss sit-downs.\n-The soundtrack likewise is a joy to listen to.\n-The overall city management is pretty well handled, although not quite as elaborate as other prominent business/city simulator games.\n-The companion characters are surprisingly detailed and memorable.\n\nCons:\n-Building upgrades have almost no meaningful variety to them. While each building technically has its own unique upgrades, they all fulfill nearly identical purposes across the board, distinguishable really only by their visual icons.\n-There is no automation for any task. You better love handling everything manually without exception, because that's effectively the only playstyle this game supports, even if it's for something as minor as handling a customer who might secretly be a government spy looking to bust you for breaking prohibition. I hire bartenders for a reason. What's the point in paying AI staff to work for me if they won't even handle anything? This kind of thing gets really annoying the 100th time it happens in a single game.\n-The game will frequently soft crash during combat sequences. I've had a single character continue to spray bullets for upwards of 5 minutes at a time nonstop, just looping the animation nonstop.\n-Hope you really love seeing the same lethal finisher animation again and again, because your character seemingly only has two: 1 for their primary weapon, and 1 for their melee. My character just cackled insanely like Mark Hamill's Joker while spraying bullets into the enemy's chest, or slitting their throat with a knife. With the cackling, it was kind of creepy over time.\n-The skill trees for both the player character and the NPCs you hire are laughably simplistic. It felt like an honestly good concept that was given almost no depth, when the game could've really benefited from having more depth.\n\nThis goes to my biggest overall gripe with this game. It doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Does it want to be a more streamlined action-driven XCOM 2 like experience? Or does it want to be this slow methodical experience that appeals to more traditional RPG and city simulator type players? The end result feels like a failure on both ends.\nI do not hate this game, there are some aspects I really enjoy. It is on the verge of being what I would consider an amazing game. But its lack of focus, and overall mediocre quality even now, almost 3 weeks after its initial launch, means I sadly cannot recommend it to anyone in its present state.\n\nMy best wishes to the Romero Games staff. The fact that you guys were able to work on this game during this time is a testament to your dedication and work ethic. I just wish your team was allowed a little more time to focus on polishing what is otherwise a very solid game.\n\n(For my full thoughts on the game, I put out a video review, linked below.)\nhttps://youtu.be/XMXmJyZIQk8", "timestamp_created": 1608645050, "timestamp_updated": 1608645050, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 152, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.905222833156585693", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82881336": {"recommendationid": "82881336", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994475597", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4355, "last_played": 1610789208}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoyed Omerta and Gangsters you will love this game.

I am the type of person that will look to find the good in everything and I really really tried with this one. I very quickly beat it and waited a few days to think about it and i gotta say it left a really sour taste in my mouth . This feels like a great foundation to a game but the house was never finished. Cops can be fully ignored the empire building comes down to building 3 buildings with pretty much no customization options and if you do customize your buildings and have your people visit them dont stay to long or they will get a STD or DEPRESSED and suffer problems (NO JOKE).\n\n           so you eventually get bored and just start taking over building after building and eventually that will piss off a fellow mob boss BUT DONT WORRY because you can waltz right over to their headquarters and go right in and fight them and after about two to four hours you should know pretty much enough to be able to beat any of them given some trial and error and then boom you have taken over their empire. Rinse wash repeat until all the mob bosses are dead and hey you beat the game . So it really boils down to a RTS mafia battle game with none of the empire building or customization that made it look so fun in the trailer .... i mean its there but its small insignificant and you definitely wont have fun with it . \n\n          I only played as a few people and i tried to give the voice acting a chance but people like Angelo are just so rough to listen to .

Recommended if you enjoy the time period, X-Com games, crime/business sims. If you're not a huge fan of those things then wait for a sale or for the DLC to be released. There are two planned DLCs at this point each bringing deeper game mechanics and more stories/characters etc. If you're not a fan of Prohibition Crime or X-Com/Business Sim games then maybe wait until the Complete Edition or the base game is on sale. \n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n* X-Com style strategic turn based combat \n\n* Decent roster of main gangsters to choose from, both real (Al Capone, Dion O'Banion etc.) and original characters each with unique playstyles and empire bonuses (some are great at combat, some are better at running brothels for cheap, some can produce more booze for cheaper etc.)\n\n* About 50 gangsters to recruit into your gang, again a good mix of real gangsters from the time period and original characters, each with their own backstories, unique story arcs, bonuses, and relationships to each other (for instance some gangsters are friends or lovers and will go into a rage if their lover is hurt or killed, some are enemies and will refuse to work together etc.) \n\n* The sitdown system and diplomacy are a welcome addition, and can make the minor gangs into useful allies or something more than just enemies to subjugate. \n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n* Gameplay can get a bit repetitive once your empire is established. With the planned DLC claiming to add extra gameplay mechanics this will likely change in the future, but for now it can be quite repetitive, especially with how slow money making can be at the start. \n\n* Bugs can often affect gameplay (sometimes animations don't load and your character just floats from pace to place, sometimes the combat screen doesn't load when you enter hostile buildings and you have to reload the save, etc.) \n\n* Some characters are far more powerful than others due to their special abilities. Goldie Garneau for instance can just about clear an entire building by herself, while Salazar Reyna's special ability often misses or fails to kill enemies even when they are in the open. This can lead to having to adopt similar or boring playstyles for weaker characters to make them viable. \n\n[b]The Ugly:[/b]\n\n* The voice acting is often pretty bad. Some characters sound like they're doing a bad imitation of how they think people sounded back then, see? \n\n* AI is terrible. They often make bad pathing and combat decisions and the trade system is skewed, you can often convince the AI to trade away their OP special weapon for a few common rarity pistols and $3000. \n\n* No fast-time option, so you're forced often to sit and do nothing for 5-10 minutes while you're waiting for money to roll in so you can upgrade your businesses. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1608615815, "timestamp_updated": 1608615815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497677475214004517", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82863516": {"recommendationid": "82863516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390891868", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 1877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1877, "last_played": 1612901529}, "language": "english", "review": "-go back in time\n-open your speakeasy\n-kill your enemies\n-go into the future \n-go home \n-play empire of sin\n\n10/10 would miss shot again.", "timestamp_created": 1608612929, "timestamp_updated": 1617247041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457000404596328735", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82862022": {"recommendationid": "82862022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034539908", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3988, "last_played": 1615521317}, "language": "english", "review": "The biggest sin in empire of sin, is that of publishing this game as a finished product rather than an Early Access. I don't know whether the onus is on the developer or the publisher or both, but it's a blatant lack of ethics  and of respect for prospective custommers. Sadly, it is increasingly common in the gaming industry.\n\nThe game is a bit further than one might expect from the initial release of an Early Access in that the storyline for each boss is already in, but as far as bugs and game mechanics polish go, I've played Early Access games that were further along the development line on day 1 of their Early Access (props to Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark team) than Empire of Sin is on an official release.\n\nSo if you chose to buy this game in the state as of this review, beware that you are buying into an Early Access for a game that will hopefully meet it's expectations only several months from now.\n\nI can't endorse this product because of the unethical marketing strategy. I would've paid full price to participate in an Early Access if it had been properly advertised as such because the genre is right up my alley and the game looked (and still looks) like it could have a lot of potential down the line.\n\nThat's the end of the short version. Details below.\n\nAs for appreciation of the game in it's current state:\n-The atmosphere and music is great albeit a little repetitive.\n-The voice acting embodying the personality of the bosses is enjoyable, although limited in scope.\n-The graphics are fine although still bug-ridden e.g.\n--Attack animations causing characters to go through walls or shoot through objects\n--Certain characters end \"frozen\" during some or all of their animations and when this happens, it appears to slow down the execution of actions.\n\n-Given the prevalence of tactical combat in the current state of the game, the fact that buildings where combat take place only have a handful few layouts for each building size quickly becomes very repetitive.\n\n-There remains a lot of gameplay bugs, even after 2 big bugfix patches. I have only experienced one that was gamebreaking and forced me to restart a new game, and it was in the intro tutorial with Goldie. However I've had to reload to last save for a couple of bugs, or save and reload right away for a handful few very annoying ones, and there are others you just accept to playthrough however annoying.\n\n-Gameplay is very shallow. And this is well above bugs as to why I feel this should've been released as an early access game. There are 2 main game systems, the tactical combat system and the empire simulation system. They intertwine by allowing you to hire better mercenaries or purchase gear or by hostile acquisition of revenue-generating buildings.\n\n--The game can be won while ignoring the empire simulation altogether. You can kill every other boss and win the game, no matter how well guarded they are, with your own boss alone on max difficulty. Part of this is game balance. Another part is heal/sustain mechanics and most likely a bug with a healing item. And an even bigger chunk is terrible combat AI.\n\n--The combat advantages gained from a good empire sim are very marginal, unless you purposefully stretch the game to wait for later game mercenaries to catch up and be fully upgraded as the cheaper/early game ones are. Gear from merchants is generally worse than the random loot you get from thug hunting/box farming.\n\n--Even with self-imposed rules or boundaries to try and explore empire simulation, the max difficulty AI is quickly outscaled. I won my second playthrough with self-imposed rules by 1923 because I had nothing else left to do than finish the bosses off. By contrast, prohibition lasted until 1933. Eventually you just realise that you would need to self-impose a lot of idle time to try and reel the player's growth potential in line with the poor AI and the simulation mechanics are neither sufficiently complex nor varied to where even very casual gamers won't figure enough out within a few hours.\n\nDespite all of that, I still have mild enjoyment playing this game because of the laid back jazz atmosphere and some of the more corny dialogue and the sheer laugh of breaking the game so hard.", "timestamp_created": 1608610420, "timestamp_updated": 1608610420, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524675905704498291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82852564": {"recommendationid": "82852564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370540108", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 831, "last_played": 1617286437}, "language": "english", "review": "Few Glitches here and there but otherwise good game", "timestamp_created": 1608595013, "timestamp_updated": 1608595013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499044924974441528", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82839904": {"recommendationid": "82839904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198871426933", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2367, "last_played": 1608584887}, "language": "english", "review": "Love It still a couple of bugs but given a bit of time to correct them would highly recommend", "timestamp_created": 1608578709, "timestamp_updated": 1608578709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492452830076217651", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82834475": {"recommendationid": "82834475", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978895201", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1029, "last_played": 1608571378}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, I got this for free through my wife who works at Paradox.

The theme is also close to my heart, so I was very tempted to buy this game. Luckily I ended up getting it for free, so I launched the game and dug in.\n\nWithin the first 20 minutes I realized that I am not actually playing a game made by an AAA studio headed by John Romero - I was playing a sort of an indie dev game that somehow had big names attached to it. The game feels like a small studio game, where the publisher has pressured the team to make a game too complex and too fast, without enough playtesting.\n\nThe game is simply clunky. From controls to camera to combat to management, everything feels like there's a good IDEA behind it, but not enough testing and not enough planning actually went in to the features. You'll very quickly realize that the AI in combat is wacky to say the least and very easy to exploit. At the same time, the management of different rackets is a bit confusing and extremely cumbersome. The story is explained through quests, but they are not very well presented, they get a bit confusing and in the end I completely ignored them. They need to be paced a lot better.\n\nOnce you snow ball in this game even a little, it's super easy to just go and take over everything, while ignoring the story, police raids etc. You just go from a generic battle to another. There's also plenty of weird little bugs that occur pretty much all the time. However I did not run into massive game breaking bugs, unlike some other people have.\n\nThere's a few longer, better reviews that outline my feelings towards the game very well:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/BadgerBrownCoat/recommended/604540/\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDeluxeTux/recommended/604540/\n\n---\n\nWith all that being said... I wish I could go into more details about everything. With less than 20 hours though, I don't feel I can do that properly. The game has many glaring, major issues and it doesn't feel like a proper, released game. However, with all its faults it is a playable game and has a certain charm to it. Of the 17 hours I have played so far, 15 were somehow still enjoyable and kept me engaged. I had fun and I didn't hate the game, even with all its faults. In a way it felt like a game that was just deep enough to interest me and shallow enough at the same time to allow me to enjoy an hour or two after work.\n\nEven though the devs have announced that there'll be DLC's coming, I don't think anyone should bother with them. Get the game in a sale, hope the devs abandon this after a few patches. I hope - and so should you - that they'll get enough money and goodwill out of this demo of a game to get funding for Empire of Sin 2, which would be properly planned and tested before release.\n\nAt the moment this game is only worth about 10 USD. I can recommend it at around that price range, and if you have tolerance for small issues. And if you like the theme. But it's not an AAA game. It's a game that feels like it's done by industry beginners.", "timestamp_created": 1608572534, "timestamp_updated": 1608572534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519043326377868652", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82808162": {"recommendationid": "82808162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006699372", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3959, "last_played": 1608748245}, "language": "english", "review": "Score 6 (could also be a NO)\n\nPlayed as the Genna family and finished the game (took about 5 years).\n\nPositives\n- Atmosphere is really excellent. The streets are alive with people, transport and their sounds. The inside of the buildings look also great although there are not many variations.\n- Nice story line(s) for the main characters. Voice overs are ok.\n- The turn based fighting and the customization of your mob members.\n\nNeutral\n- Business simulation has not a lot of depth in it. There is no downside in over building and over producing. Prices are always stable. So a lot of building will result in a runaway winner.\n- Communication between families is too random and illogical. e.g the moment they want to ask for your protection, while you haven't the means to do so. Or every minor faction asking for extra products all at the same time.\n- UX good use some improvement: better viewing of the entire map, direct jump to characters, zoom in to cursor and more. \n\nNegatives\n-  Pathing during fights and on the map view. On the map view this will result being stuck. In fights wrong choices are being made by the AI, e.g. cover is more valued than distance, which could result in having some cover but they stop next to you.\n- When at war you don't have a good enough overview to handle threats. Attacks just start out of the blue, which are mostly boring fights.\n- Most of the time you are not the boss of the family. The balance between running the family and doing footwork is wrong. Most of the game you get the feeling you play as an associate or a made man instead of handling the strategic part of running the family.\n\nAbout the last point. My personal preference would be to add more roleplaying elements with a growth in character in stead of in rackets. \nYou can have to first half of the game working up the ranks and doing a lot of footwork and in the later part you direct the footwork. \nIn the first half you learn the trade of one of the four rackets to have specialization bonuses later in the game. \nIn the first half of the game interaction with the police is more prevalent. In the later game politics will be more important. \nAlmost all elements are available in the game to some extent.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1608535839, "timestamp_updated": 1608535839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82804466": {"recommendationid": "82804466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137548307", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1104, "last_played": 1608612180}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVED", "timestamp_created": 1608528800, "timestamp_updated": 1608528800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469340056180953979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82802303": {"recommendationid": "82802303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145595587", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 912, "last_played": 1614572358}, "language": "english", "review": "it's an exceptionally good skeleton and based for improvements to come.", "timestamp_created": 1608524777, "timestamp_updated": 1608524777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499013811349868774", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82799371": {"recommendationid": "82799371", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991158558", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 9102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9102, "last_played": 1608458274}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, I was really excited for this one, but the game is just too broken to play.

I don't hate the game, but it's super buggy and unbalanced.\n\n[h1]Beta 1.03[/h1]\nPatch 1.03 is in beta right now and it seems to have completely changed the flow of the game. Many of the bugs and exploits have been fixed and I'm enjoying it quite a bit more now. This should have been the launch state of the game, I am growing tired of video games launching it a crap state and then patching it out months later. You want your money? Give me a quality game from the start.\n\n[h1]Bugs[/h1]\n1. Battle will start, but the first character's turn will never begin. Game and save breaking.\n2. Animation bugs where a character will be stuck in the shooting and downed pose. When animation bugs occur the time to take an action increases dramatically.\n3. Occasionally, you won't be able to attack a building. You confirm when prompted and it just sits there.\n4. Hotel Synergies go all crazy sometimes. I've had to SELL a racket to get all of the synergies before.\n5. Battles don't end when you kill the last enemy if 2 friendly factions are at war with each other.\n6. Death animations do weird things when using melee attacks.\n7. Sometimes the UI shows an action unavailable (no color) like you don't have action points, when you're full action points and can execute the action anyways.\n\n[h1]Balance Issues[/h1]\nEDIT: I just want to say, this game was the first game I received all of the achievements. It is incredibly unbalanced, resulting in a strategy game that requires no strategy.\n1. AI will accept absurd trades. There are a lot of exploits that stem from this issue.\n2. You can trade for the AI faction's unique weapons and they'll never equip another one, leaving them weaponless in battle.\n3. Quick travel takes no time. This allows you to explore the whole map, meet all of the factions, and collect all hidden stashes in one in-game week.\n4. Stashes are on the map from the start of the game. This makes the game trivial. Collect a few good stashes, equip your team, kill every enemy. Why interact with rackets, synergies, trade-deals, or quests?\n5. Healing can be done instantly by quick travel to safehouse, which costs nothing. It can also be done using skills by starting an ambush, using healing skill, cancelling ambush, and repeating. This makes the doctor passive heal pointless.\n6. Weapon type traits can be earned by accumulating kills and thugs are crazy easy to kill and plentiful.\n7. Rifles shadow sniper rifles by doing similar damage for 1 AP instead of 2 AP. Same with Submachine guns and Machine guns. Shotguns spead shot has the same accuracy and damage as the single-target shot. Why even have a single-target shot? Just use the multi-target one every time.\n8. Explosives (excluding time-bomb) have no counter-play. Spawn into a fight, enemy gets their first turn, throws bomb into the pack where you spawned and you've lost multiple gangsters. All explosives should be timed or not an instant-kill.\n9. Better gang members shouldn't cost notoriety AND money. By the time you can hire the better gangsters, you've already trained up your cheap gangsters to be very strong. Additionally, 10% income cost is insane enough, but another $30,000-$70,000 on top of that? Never going to be worth it.\n\n[h1]Quality of Life[/h1]\n1. No window-borderless option in 2020. Single person made early access games even have this.\n2. The hotkeys are dynamic and it screws me up constantly. One minute the [3] key is swap weapon, the next minute [4] is swap weapon and [3] is reload. This screws me up CONSTANTLY. Please make these static.\n3. The Escape key unpausing the game is annoying. I'm just trying to bring the menu up to save and you unpause it and then something always manages to pop-up at that very second. Let me bring up the menu while paused.\n\n[h1]Future Requests[/h1]\n1. Repetitive dialog option variety. I am tired of hearing Al Capone say \"What's this a free lunch?\" I don't need variety for everything, but the dialog options that are common, like making a deal, should have some variety.\n2. Thugs are all the same, weak and boring. Add more enemy types, both graphically and mechanically. They don't have to be strong, since they're thugs, but at least have them do something different.\n3. I would like to see more depth added to mechanics around rackets. Hotel synergy is nice when it works. Add more things like this.\n4. No more DLC weapons. Those things are OP and I would love an option to make them basic guns instead of legendary, aka basically a weapon skin instead.\n\nI'm going to keep playing this game.

You get a vast number of mafia bosses to start with, most (if not all?) being historically based on a real person, tasked with dominating the entire town of Chicago starting with one small brewery, speakeasy, and safehouse. While I am typing this, I only have around 10 hours in-game. It's a very well thought out idea in general, and has so much potential, but in it's current state, it still has some issues that end up being just a bit annoying. First of all, the beginning of the game is always the same/very similar, spawning usually in the same areas and with the same power. Next, on most difficulty levels, unless you're really avoiding it, it's pretty easy to take out other factions, by just fast travelling there and walking in with 3-5 guys, which makes it a bit tedious instead of action packed and interesting. Why not have hidden safehouses so you actually have to put great efforts into defeating other prominent mafiosos?\nThen last but not least, the mixing of the voice acting is simply terrible, some characters are too quiet and others too loud (Example: Angelo Genna is rather quiet while some companions are far too loud) and in execution scenes/other special moments, you can hear whoever is executing is clearly saying special dialogue, but barely hear it with the fact that whatever stabbing/shooting/other noise is 125% louder.\n\nTl;dr: Empire of Sin has great potential and I'm very happy with it, but it has a lot of issues that need to be addressed, too easy to play, not a lot of variation at the start, and terrible sound design.

Their AI is meagerly depressing. Where at one point, while defeating a rival boss, for three turns in a row the remaining enemies just spammed overwatch whilst I shot them to pieces. There's nothing I saw to indicate what skills enemy goons will have, nor your own goons defending places. In the goon vs goon combats, they can drag on dreadfully long thanks to this and their poor stats.\nThe risk of a game over is typically barely a threat, BUT I have faced heavy losses from when the AI spammed explosives (which are guaranteed decent chunks of damage), and did game over when one of the generic enemy goons turned out to have the meat hook skill to pull my boss into the wide open of five enemies and they focus fired on them.\n\nEmpire management in this game is technically there, but it is basically just upgrading without thought as all of it is beneficial. The alcohol production has some level of matching the demand that the neighborhoods want, but they'll all reach Whiskey guaranteed if you buy everything. Police apparently can shut down your businesses but unless you're actively slaughtering them I don't think they'll do anything. I could be wrong but they never bothered me.\n\nDiplomacy between factions is present. Everyone seems highly eager to hate you however, unless you fork over absurd amounts of money to them. There's a \"like\" meter and a \"threat\" meter. The standing arrangements you can typically make with them however are very lackluster in power, and the only reasonable use for trading with them would be to snag a Unique tier weapon without having to kill them. Supposedly you can offer to protect others for money, but when I tried my \"threat\" was too high or something and it wouldn't let me. Along with this is a thing called a Mole for espionage. You send them to infiltrate an enemy faction and after six months, you sabotage them in some form depending on the class of the gangster you send in. However, six months is a very hefty chunk of time, and they're not guaranteed to succeed. For reference, I killed 6 enemy bosses or so after setting out my mole, and they never did their job. \n\nIn a similar vein to diplomacy, there is the gangsters and their relationship system. Some of your hires like, hate, or love others. They will refuse to shoot those that they like, and there's some interactions if you have their lover in your group, but I cannot tell if there's any benefits or if it's just drawbacks, as I believe they gain a negative status effect if their lover is low health. However, if you kill someone they just like, there's a chance that they will get upset and just leave. Which, to keep that, you'd need to ask a favour from another faction to kill the person they like if an enemy boss has them and you want to ensure you keep this one gangster. Overall the system here is barren but does have groundworks with some unique gangster specific quests (I have only seen two of them with a quest though).\n\nEverything about this game is just average. It's meh.

It's not a perfect game, but I have a lot of fun when I am playing it and it does keep me coming back.\n\nThe setting is great, and I love the different feels to each of the neighborhoods in Chicago.  I really like the dynamic zoom mechanic that the developers made for this game, where you can smooth-scroll from inside a building to outside the building, to a view of the street, to a tactical view of the neighborhood, to a tactical view of all neighborhoods, all in real-time.  This feature is great and is not getting nearly enough credit in the reviews.\n\nThe game has quite a bit going on with it.  You've got a light economic management thing going on, which mostly consists of producing and setting the correct types of booze, and buying or taking over buildings.   You can also upgrade establishments, but with the current build of the game (Dec 2020), upgrades are usually not worth it, as they are expensive and take a long time to build after you pay for them.  The game rewards going as wide as possible as quickly as possible, so my go-to strategy is basically to start to clear out and take over the neutral casinos and speakeasies as soon as a new game starts.\n\nMeanwhile, you've got a bunch of other mob bosses running around setting up their own empires.  When you meet one, you can either tell them to go pound sand or you can sit down with them to cut a deal.  The deals that you cut with the mob bosses are so incremental that they are barely noticeable, but I think the sit-downs themselves are quite fun, if a tad repetitive.  After your initial meeting, there are a range of diplomacy options available.  These are generally pretty useless, except for the trading, which is currently rigged in the player's favor.  It does not take much to convince bosses to sell your their unique weapons in exchange for some garbage ones and have them walk away thinking they got the better of you.\n\nWhile it is currently very easy to complete the game without diplomacy at all, diplomacy can be used to win, in a manner of speaking.  I did play a game where I quietly took over unoccupied neighborhoods and made nice with all mob bosses and stepped on no toes.  Then, I sold them all weapons for peanuts, and they all trusted me.  Then, I kept calling in favors and repeatedly called in a hit on every boss with every other boss, and watched them wipe each other out.  Then, when there was one left, I just went in with a small team and took that person out.\n\nYou've also got an RPG-like quest system in this game.  There's a few generic quests available to every mob boss; these were fun in my first playthrough but the rewards were pretty crappy so I have more or less ignored most of them since.  Each boss also has a main questline, this can be a nice diversion.\n\nFinally, you've got the gangster system and the tactical battles.\n\nThe gangster system is a neat idea and does a lot of things right, but needs a bit of work.  There is a roster of henchmen that both you and the CPU opponents can hire.  While theoretically you can assign your henchmen as neighborhood managers or as protectors of one of your buildings, in reality you and your henchmen will all fight together as a roving squad of death, as that is by far the most effective use for them.  Gangsters have different classes, but the doctor and demolitionist classes are far superior to any of the other three, as doctors get free healing and can also use rifles, the best weapon in the game, and demolitionists get a free grenade that does massive AOE damage and causes bleeding. As you increase in notoriety, you can hire more expensive and more skilled henchmen.  Currently, there is not much difference between the cheapest goons and the most elite killers; I would love to see the lower tiers of henchmen nerfed quite a bit, and the higher tiers buffed.\n\nThe tactical battles are the best part of the game and are the reason I keep coming back.  The difficulty is generally pretty easy, except when you are up against a group of enemies who all decide to lob grenades on the same turn.  The safehouse raids are so much fun!  (they need to be harder, though, and a greater variety of safehouses would be sweet).\n\nEmpire of Sin also has a great score by Crimson Diamond composer Dan Policar and team; I would pay extra for a soundtrack if Paradox decides to sell one (please, Paradox!).\n\nAll in all, this game is a lot of fun right now, but also has a lot of room for improvement.

This game should have released into Early Access. The cons at this timely, simply outweigh the pros.\n\nPros :\n- Game looks nice and plays smoothly\n- Mafia theme\n- Varied characters to choose as your boss / avatar\n- Nice variety of weapons\n- Gangster Roster - plenty of minor characters to choose from as your hired thugs\n- Music / Soundtrack really fits the theme\n\nCons :\n- Too many bugs and glitches for a full release\n- Unbalanced abilities \n- Repetitive combat at times when the AI attacks and you have to complete fight after fight\n- Game mechanics too bare bones\n- AI needs working on\n- Mission / quests badly paced out\n\nThis game has only been out for a couple of weeks but really needs some patching. Fun enough to play, assuming you can get past all it's current faults. Current recommendation : wait for a sale and/or for the game to be fully patched / updated before buying.\n\nRating : 5/10 Average (but on the bit disppointing side).\n\nPOST PATCH :  Devs have done some work to this game so it's time to change my review a bit :\n\nPros : \n- Safe Houses are now hidden and you can't bum rush your rivals any more :)\n- A lot of the quests seem to work fine now\n- The \"loot boxes\" you can find all over the map have been re-balanced and are more rare\n- 12 different 'skins' for all the generic thugs makes for a better experience, rather than all 1 generic type\n- weapons and bosses have been nerfed a bit and difficulties have been adjusted\n- Ability to skip 'non essential' fights\n- Guards get better 'upgrades' for each upgrade level\n\nCons :\n- Rackets are still a bit bare bones - need more variety\n- Animations of the in game models still bug out from time to time\n- Quests still seem to be assigned all together 'in a bunch' rather than spaced out more\n- Some bugs for first version of the game still persisting\n- AI still needs some work\n\nOverall, the new patch shows alot of promise. I hope the devs continue supporting and working on this game.

I killed Eddie, combat mode ended, then Eddie got up and walked out.  WTF?  So I couldn't complete that mission.  \n\nOkay, whatever.  So I just start racking up money by ransacking joints.  Taking over joints and managing them is a headache.  The empire management is tedious and really unnecessary when you can just ransack it and get money right away.

You kill their guards outside, which is very easy, then you kill everyone inside, which can be slightly difficult.  Combat is VERY repetitive and not very rewarding after the first three or four combat situations.  So then I just go to a rival gang safehouse, wipe out gang, get their empire, repeat until I killed all the mob bosses and won the game.  The endgame after I killed everyone is bizarre to say the least.  \n\nThis game has so much potential, but they forgot to actually make a story and make the different components of the game actually matter.

Perhaps you would be a Smart Operator, and always keep your enemies next close to you.  Or an Enforcer, who bullies everyone on sight. A Con Artist who would sell gallons of water pretending that it\u2019s the finest whiskey ever made (well, that would be a bit far-fetched but after 5 or 7 drinks it\u2019s usually hard to tell!).  Well, here is your chance to become one of the most fearful individuals of that time! So, forget about it (your sins) and built a mighty empire in the charming downtown Chicago.  So boss, what\u2019s next in the Empire of Sin?\n\nEmpire of Sin is an RTS/turn-based strategy/management game developed by Romero Games and published by Paradox Interactive on the Steam platform on the 2nd of December 2020. \n\nThe first thing you have to do before writing your history in downtown 1920\u2019s Chicago is to set up a game. You\u2019ll have to choose one of the 14 available characters, each with 4 specific abilities.  Some of these characters were actual gangsters, such as Al Capone, Angelo Genna and Daniel McKee Jackson, while others are fictional. Then you\u2019ll have to choose how many neighbourhoods (3 to 10) Chicago will be divided into, how many factions will be participating in the struggle, and finally, in which level of difficulty you\u2019ll be playing the game.  They are 5 in total from Associate to Boss. I strongly recommend the Normal (or in this case the Lieutenant) difficulty on your first playthrough.\n\nAs you appear for the first time in one of Chicago\u2019s neighbourhoods (will depend on who you have chosen as a boss), a fellow will appear on the bottom left of your screen. He will show you the ropes, including the options you have within the game (tutorial). He will appear every time you have to learn a new game feature, but you can disable it at any given time. \nThe game is pretty much a real-time strategy game with three distinct phases which you can swap between at any time. An important point to mention is that you can also pause the game when you want to check the status of your rackets, or upgrade them, hire new gangsters and equip them, try to form an alliance with other family bosses or even bribe the police department. \n\nThe main phase is the Chicago map which you can zoom out to see all the suburbs and zoom in straight onto the street, where you can move and command your group of gangsters about what to do next. You\u2019ll have a few rackets in your neighbourhood at the start of each game. By zooming out onto the suburb view, you\u2019ll be able to see which buildings you own, other families or factions who own rackets and another two types of buildings you can acquire. The vacant buildings have a green dollar sign icon on them, and the buildings that have an orange target icon on them are occupied by thugs!  You\u2019ll need enough money in your coffin to purchase the property first and then convert it to one racket of your choice, which is speakeasies, brothels, casinos, breweries, hotels and safe houses. You can avoid forking out any money by attacking another family racket and taking it over, but you\u2019ll be at war with them straight away. You best bet is to attack the building where the thugs are. At least you wont have to buy the property, but it will still cost you to convert the building into a racket. If you decide to explore other neighbourhoods, you can do so by clicking on the taxi icons located somewhere in each suburb. \n\nYou\u2019ll trigger the combat phases by attacking a building and on most occasions, you\u2019ll need to battle the guards outside and inside the buildings. Beware not to attack a building if you see the cops walking on the same street as they will jump into the gunfight to try to arrest all the people involved. Sure, you can kill them if you want, but the relationship with the police department will take a big hit each time you gun down an officer. And let me tell you, you\u2019ll blow serious money with corrupt cops to try to rectify the issue. Your best bet is to escape by positioning your characters onto the white square on the edges of the battle map (street). \n\nEach gangster at your disposal will have two action points which you can use for movements and actions such as shooting at an enemy, using the overwatch and more. More combat options will be available to each of your gangsters as they learn new abilities. In the Lieutenant level of difficulty, you\u2019ll probably win most of your battles against the thugs, and other families\u2019 guarded rackets. Eliminating a family boss in their safehouse might be slightly more complicated, but you should be able to beat them if you have 6 to 8 gangsters in your group with a good arsenal. However, it will be challenging if you decide to play on the underboss or boss difficulty levels.\n\nThe third phase is the management side where you can hire gangsters, use the diplomacy tab and see your rackets and how much there are making per week. There is also a mission tab where missions will appear as you go along. I strongly recommend completing a few missions and you\u2019ll be rewarded with money and notoriety points which you\u2019ll need in order to unlock new and better gangsters for hiring. You\u2019ll also need notoriety points to set up your organisation with an advisor and an underboss. \n\nAs your empire starts to grow, you\u2019ll undoubtedly be at war with other families. I\u2019d try to be at war with one at a time and concentrate on taking over all their rackets as fast as possible. What you need to beware of is retaliation; they will attack you either by themselves or with one or more other families. So make sure to upgrade your buildings\u2019 security, but you\u2019ll need money for that. More guards and you\u2019ll have more chances to retain your rackets. You\u2019ll also need money to upgrade each of these rackets\u2019 ambience, advertise them by word of mouth as well as upgrading the deflect (appearance of being something other than what it is) to avoid raids.

Between his melee and his sniper rifle, I can send him in alone vs 8 other thugs and come out on top without being hit most of the time.

I appreciate what the Romeros are trying to bring to the table with Empire of Sin, but for now the game falls short in core aspects of execution. Hopefully, this will someday be a game that I feel gives me my money's\u00a0worth. 2/5 stars.\n\nLast month I bought and completed Hard West, a game I greatly enjoyed for its combat mechanics and level design. A few days after my interest in HW ran its course, I saw Empire of Sin in the store. It seemed to promise a lot of the things I loved about games like XCOM and HW, but with an innovative scalable strategy layer and an emergent narrative based on 1920's Prohibition Chicago. Being a Paradox game I somewhat expected it to come out half-baked with a ton of issues, but this is a rare effort at an XCOM competitor and Paradox are generally good about supporting games for a long time.\n\nI hope that continued support is the case here, because the tactical gameplay in this game gets old very quickly. At the outset the game shows a ton of promise, in 3 attempts at starting a campaign so far my favorite part each time was the solo missions at the beginning. The \"boss\" character of your gang really lives up to this name, and taking down 5 or 8 enemy thugs in just a few turns is a great introduction to the combat system. After taking over a few rackets, earning a few made henchmen, then assaulting a rival gang's safehouse to overpower their leader and seize their territory, you can really immerse in the game's promise of being a criminal overlord with an empire.\n\nWhat follows is where the game becomes bogged down in itself. Running multiple gang wars when you own a sprawling empire is an exercise in tedium. Your racket guards are hopelessly inept at lower levels, and when a racket is raided by the enemy you're ripped away from your boss character and are stuck controlling \"60 hp woman with lead pipe\" or \"55 hp man with short-barreled shotgun\", typically against an equally inept force of random enemy thugs. Then, when your guards lose you immediately get to repeat the experience inside your racket.\n\nThe tedious gang wars also highlight the repetitiveness of the different buildings. Each building can be \"small\", \"medium\" or \"large\" and the interiors of each racket type do not vary much. So, in a short span the game goes from being a very enjoyable stint as the baddest guy in town, to fighting through a hopeless slog with no-name characters in the same environments over, and over, and over. This is not an enjoyable experience for a turn-based shooter.\n\nThe strategy layer provides more scale than depth, which would certainly be forgivable if the combat sequence was more engaging. Owning 30+ rackets in a neighborhood, each with 20+ upgrade levels, with 10 neighborhoods as default, quickly becomes a chore when the ultimate outcome is that each time you make slightly more profit or the guard battles become slightly less tedious due to upgrades. \n\nImmediate improvements to the tactical layer that I would suggest are:\n-Make the player character and their made men essential to the core game mechanic: turn-based tactics. It is not as enjoyable to fight battles where they are not involved, and these should be automated 100% of the time. It might be workable to give the player a way for responding to such events, such as posting made men at the neighborhood safehouse and having them immediately respond to help the guards against any raids in that neighborhood.\n-Make combat involvement mostly line-of-sight based rather than area based. Having a random group of thugs in an alley around the block or a faraway policeman become mandatory elements of combat because they were within X tiles of the ambush is never an enjoyable surprise.\n-The controls sequence for fighting battles with a controller is not intuitive to work through, and sometimes limits player options compared to KB+M. In my opinion, XCOM: Chimera Squad is the gold standard of intuitive controller support in the tactical layer and I think it would be a good thing if this game had a similar controls sequence.\n-Speaking of XCOM:CS, their breach system was a fantastic innovation in the genre. I think that a similar mechanic for raids in Empire of Sin would provide a sorely-needed breath of fresh air to the short roster of interior combat environments. Breaching from outside in would also help solve the disconnect between the outdoor and indoor environments in this game, which at present feel like different worlds (see: no-name guard battle progression).", "timestamp_created": 1607717247, "timestamp_updated": 1607717479, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82101531": {"recommendationid": "82101531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202975070", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2550, "last_played": 1609454025}, "language": "english", "review": "still has some bugs to work out, but fun and addictive to play\n", "timestamp_created": 1607714733, "timestamp_updated": 1607714733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82096535": {"recommendationid": "82096535", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023577361", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1618594936}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game some bugs but this does not make it unplayable", "timestamp_created": 1607710545, "timestamp_updated": 1607710545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520053565502166748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82093482": {"recommendationid": "82093482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340168051", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3502, "last_played": 1613928748}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a lot of bugs, many are game breaking and they started to come out after the 2 hour refund mark.

Assign a Lt and he gives minor bonuses to the region, but he does not form his own crew or control anything so you're again stuck with running around to take over or control the area.

Set in Chicago during Prohibition the time period was a boon for organized crime.  But if you are looking for intrigue, complexity and multiple paths to victory, you need to pass on this game.\n\nThis game is more monopoly with guns than Boardwalk Empire.  More X-COM clone without the tactical difficulty or resource management required to win.  And in a game where you are vying to control the Chicago underworld, it criminally comes without multiplayer.\n\nThe gold standard for mafia management games remains Gangsters from the 90s.  There the developer worked out how you could win by both conquest and political intrigue.  You'd think with a successful formal like that the developer could have just given that game a face lift and asked for your money.\n\nBut you'd be wrong.  Just like you would be wrong to buy this game or it's DLC.  Right now the DLC provides you with 3 Golden Guns, they really don't make much difference, a fur coat for Al Capone, and not much else.  If you did have to buy this game I'd wait till it fell to 9.99.\n\nThe game launched with enough bugs to make you think it was pre-alpha.  Keep in mind no one forced them to launch the game.  Much of the updates have been spent fixing what should have been done during development and play testing.  It's hard to understand why these issues weren't fixed during that time given the that game is so miserably shallow.\n\nThe game loses it's appeal rather quickly.

I think this game should be in early access instead of a finished product. The game can get kind of repetitive after awhile. Also the sit downs to me seems like a waste of time you cant really negotiate at all. You have one or two choices and that's it? Like why even sit down? Mod bosses would always try to aim for a better deal then the one being offered so not having the ability to argue the price up and down is a bit of a disappointment to me. I do agree the DLC guns a bit OP to start with but they are suppose to be a legendary gun. I would maybe change it to where you can collect the DLC guns at a later date by completing a quest or something, during a time the guns wont be so overpowered. I think only the machine gun is overpowered. Now as for bosses i think they are fine. A boss is suppose to be powerful and to the people saying the bosses are to OP then leave your boss at home and only send your goons if you want more of a challenge. During a boss on boss fight your gonna need him then. Bosses really never got into to many of the fights to begin with in the movies and such. They just sent in the goons. This game has a great starting point i just think there is a lot that needs to be added and worked on. Make having sit downs and alliances more fun because right now with thing how they are the diplomat system sucks. Also why is there sooooooooo many girl chars and bosses? in the 1920s this wasn't a common thing i agree maybe a few of them? but it seems to me there are more girl goons and bosses then guys. I don't want to sound sexist or anything because i love the lady's don't get me wrong but in the 1920s i don't find this to be something that was natural. There was a few woman gangsters yes but not as many as this game has. Guy bosses would not respect a dame boss. I think you all have great starting point, But this game needs a lot of TLC = Tender loving care. Also why not give people the options to customize a boss and crew so they can add them self into the game with maybe a set story line you make for custom bosses.\n\nI like some of the game but untill a few things are changed right now i can not recommend this game. It needs thing added like cars, Drive bys and so much more. Give us stuff to spend money on and do? Make it so we can take out goons out to one of our strip joints or restaurants and earn more loyalty and moral? Add cars for us to buy that gets us around faster and makes it so we can do drive bys on businesses!

[/i]\n\n[b] Verdict [/b]\nEmpire of Sin has established itself as the leader of the pack when it comes to organized crime-based strategic gaming at the moment, but there\u2019s still plenty of room left for improvement. For the Paradox fans out there who see their name attached to this, it\u2019s nowhere near a grand strategy, so you can go ahead and let go of those expectations before you enter the gate. It is, however, a fairly well done criminal business sim with a solid tactical combat side packed full of plenty of RPG elements and an atmosphere of the era that few games can top. For the more hardcore strategy gamers among us, it could use quite a bit more depth to keep us interested as the management and emergent storytelling side isn\u2019t developed enough. That said, I had a good time with this title and I\u2019ll definitely be putting plenty of hours into it in the future, especially if Romero Games takes a page from the Paradox playbook and supports its development with mountains of updates and DLC. You can\u2019t go wrong with it as long as you temper your expectations for it being the next Europa Universalis IV.\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1607629838, "timestamp_updated": 1607629838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541345834732055664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82010612": {"recommendationid": "82010612", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996907790", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1606923776}, "language": "english", "review": "Unfinished mess.

This is the biggest issue of the game, You can win game easily by just attacking another boss and taking his/her kingdom. There is no reason to control casinos or other structures. Also, you need a lot of money to upgrade structures. You can easily get some cash by attacking some building which  are not controlled by bosses and get some guns (green items) as part of the loot. After that you trade them for cash with other bosses. You can even buy epic guns from bosses (after you sold enough of cheap guns). Other bosses are always happy to trade all the cash they have for some useless cheap guns which you offer to them. There is no point of building anything. Just attack minor factions, loot guns, sell guns, hire more people. Also, upgrading building doesn't feel like you made some big step. You don't get some better interactions with environment or something. During the fights, there is limited number of maps.\nThere are some bugs, like some missions are not doable, or npc can't be reached, member of the crew is gone. However, fixing these bugs won't solve the main issue and that is the game mechanics. \nI just think that they need to start from the scratch. Keep look and feel of the streets (zoomed in view) which is great, but rest of the game should to be rebuilt.", "timestamp_created": 1607610395, "timestamp_updated": 1607610395, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81973847": {"recommendationid": "81973847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064763926", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 676, "last_played": 1607079826}, "language": "english", "review": "tldr:  I told myself not to pre-buy games, but I did coz I thought this one looked so good.

You can't hire and order a group for a \"Gang Warfare\" as you can only send you're named mobsters and that's limited to a max of 10.  Then you have this awful turn based combat system that's just stupidly repetitive.  It's ok when attacking as you're over powered named gangster you hire can smash through everyone, the only challenge is a safehouse.\n\nYou're micro controlling the named gangsters all they way through.\n\nThen there is the defending when you get attacked.  The AI can send numerous mobs at a time against you're pitiful defence of a building.  No way to send or call for backup, you're outnumbered, outgunned and it's irritating and again stupid.  You're forced to watch them attack in large numbers against 1-4 defenders and you have to take control of it.  I was attacked by numerous gangs and was stuck \"defending\" building after building for about 15 minutes.  Stupid.  You should be able to group your gang / henchmen together but you can't control them as you only have control of your hired named mobsters which could be on the other side of the map or even another \"province\".\n\nIs it worth it?  Nope.\n\nWill there be updates to enable you to hire henchmen to have a proper gang war?

YOU RECRUIT A BUNCH OF NOBODIES WHICH THEY COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO PUT DIALOGUE FOR. ALL THE RECRUITS ARE BASED AROUND DIFFERENT CLASSES(ENFORCER/HIRED GUN/DEMOLITIONIST/CON ARTIST) THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME SET OF ABILITIES FOR YOU TO CHOOSE FROM. YOU PICK 1!!!!! YOU CAN HAVE 5 SKILLS FOR EACH CHARACTER OUT OF THE MAYBE 12 THEY SET PER CLASS. HOLY HELL!\n\nThere's no point in getting it fr. Nothing is stopping you from picking an overpowered, end in one turn mafia boss, murdering every other enemy faction's boss and just take their territory. Then the game ends. You can't even load your last save if you wanted to continue to manage the SHIT of an economy to manage. You make beer. That goes to every one of the 4 interactive buildings that you can upgrade for the low low cost of like 1k-7k per upgrade.\n\nI played two different saves and my completing one was Al Capone! At max skill level since he is a hired gun class he has an ability called Kill Chain! Guess what kill chain does! Kill one person you refresh your turn until you run out of ACTION POINTS or bullets. Cover system is fucked so both enemies and you can shoot each other from across the play area STILL CRIT AND KILL EACH OTHER.\n\nCombat is just a matter of how many turns can you get before they get their first one. Or any for that matter.\n\nAint worth a preorder bonus of a character that plays like everyone else. i dont even care to remember what else came with the pre order package. I wonder how the capone skin looked like because it didnt even seem like you can customize any character's fashion or looks. Oh well.\n\nMaybe down the road it'll be worth something but I found no roadmap on youtube or discussions so fuck it I guess...\n\nOh well. I rambled. First review and I just got off work. I would play empire of sin but sadly, you can finish the game in just minutes and all other chosen mafia bosses play out the same. Fuck it I guess\n\n2/22/21\nI know my review back then isn't fair or even comprehensive for that matter. I'm not gonna lie. It still stands homies. After a couple patches I guess the fundamentals were just changed.\n\nTurn based combat with \"uniquely\" classed characters is horrible. I can never guess when I'm gonna land a hit with the different weapons. It seems the only consistent one is the boss you select since you spend the most time with them. The combat is boring and when the game forces you to defend your rackets with guards you've expensively paid to lay their life down for you. They can't aim for shit. Those guys are better off hitting shit with a super soaker than a gun. Guard defense prompts as repetitive as they get in the mid game, is kind of the only activity to do in this game. You kinda have to wait on money to do anything. The combat gets boring but its the only thing it has going for it unfortunately. You can either try to finish the fights as fast as possible in one turn or just hope to outnumber them before they get their turn in. Oh well. I guess. 45 hours later btw.\n\nPlaying monopoly- it's okay. It's not even decent though. The only thing you sell is different type of liquor to the speakeasy business you gain through either conquest or purchase. Make sure you aren't producing more than you're selling and you spam click a couple buttons until your neighborhood breweries sell the consumer desired liquor. Not worth much. Not to mention it takes awhile to make any significant cash flow it's not worth going to the late game. It's just taking over AI thug occupied building over and over again one by one when you may have a squad of like 7 to roam. \n\nBottom line(not my conclusion)\nThe game can still be beat incredibly fast. \nLacks content on every level. Some of the missions don't even play all the way through before bugging and restart.\nSlow and grindy for an afk management game.\nAbundance of notifications on screen that pause game, THUS NOT GENERATING ANY MONEY.\n(SERIOUSLY WHY DO I NEED TO BE ALERTED ABOUT OTHER GANGWARS THAT ARE OCCURING TO THE POINT WHERE IT STOPS THE GAME. THAT SO SILLY. OR HAVE TO AGREE TO A SHITTY CHEAP BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT.\n\nMy personal conclusion: After investing another 40hrs into the game to reach late game as well as achievement hunt. I don't even want to bother doing all of em. It's just me making sure I've killed every boss as every boss. That's like 13+ playthroughs of dry combat and slow grinding it like I was at prom off a perc. Dude I paid an extra $10 for Al Capone and he plays like the fucking rest. They all play like the fucking rest. Even the AI hires you can pay to become apart of your mob are just subpar sequels to your work. If YOU as the player can't kill something in one hit. Your hires may or not be able to. I'm frustrated. It's whatever. I like writing. If anyone needs scripts or ideas. Even someone at this team because the game really needs dialogue(lacking any voice acting or even conversation for that matter).

Then as soon as  things started to heat up a little I realized what people were complaining about. Here's in a nutshell why I gave this game a negative review.\n1- bugs, yes lots but really I know this will be sorted out eventually so I'm not to critical about this one\n2- User Interface. This is a big one for me. Some design choices are really poor, and the information you need is all over the place or absent. For example your businesses keep getting attack during a war but they don't show you on the map where it is and don't give you the option to skip the fight if its a small one. At one point it took me like 45 minutes just to talk to someone because every time I tried i was getting interrupt by  fight notifications from god knows where on the map. Anyway its just a small example. But the problems are plenty.\n3 - In the combat phase, it just make no sense that when you enter a building to attack you start the fight in a random place. sometime its even in a room in the back of the building surrounded by bad guys. Given that we can't decide which of our characters we want to move first (because we need to follow  the initiative order), this is a BIG deal. You can get almost wipe before even having a chance to do anything. When you enter a building to attack you should either get a deployment zone near the door where you can place your men, or you should be able to enter in real-time and have  the combat mode start when the enemy sees you for the first time like in Phantom Doctrine. Pretty basic.\n- Your whole organisation is pretty much limited to the gangster you can hire from the pool of 30 something mobsters with a couple of random pawn at each business. Yet your enemies have plenty of men and they seems to be able to attack, hunt, stalk targets and do plenty of things that you can't. either that or I didn't found where to give these orders to my men.\n- I could go on forever about poor design choices but I will stop there. I've played for 5 hours and I do not feel like trying anymore. I thing I will monitor the discussion forum to see if they make any drastic changes maybe i'll come back.

These boss units tend to be stupidly powerful, for better or worse, being able to take down most enemy units with ease or even alone if given enough time.\n\nThe soundtrack of the game is pretty good and fits the themes the game is going for very well.\n\nGraphically, the game is mediocre. Some models look fine, but things like cutscenes can look a bit cheap. I didn't personally mind these that much, but they can stand out quite a bit.\n\nAs many people have reported, the game is sadly riddled with bugs, from minor ones such as animation glitches or characters taking 5 seconds to initiate an attack or end turn, to major ones such as constant crashes (I've experienced so far 4 during my 6  hours of playing the game) and other irregularities. The list is sadly too big to count, with seemingly every player encountering their own unique ones based on reviews that I've seen. The game does feel like early access a lot more than game that should be launched with deluxe editions and whatnot (also don't buy the golden weapons pack, it makes the game way too easy, and it's already very easy even on the higher difficulties).\n\nThe game is also pretty badly balanced overall and some gameplay mechanics feel either poorly executed/planned or just overall unfinished. Combat encounters start with units seeking cover, but you can't decide it, so they can just stand out in the open. Attacks on enemy bosses can be over in few turns or you can get killed without a proper chance to fight back at all. You can be right next to enemy, but as they are next to a wall, your chance to hit them is lowered by 40%. The list again is sadly too long to be written here, but just count on me, it's quite extensive.\n\nThe shallowness of the gameplay and the quest system are the final nails in this game's coffin. I do, however, hope/think that the game will be salvaged, but it's going to need a lot more than bug fixes to earn favorable reviews I imagine. Right now, I can barely imagine myself finishing a single playthrough and I have zero motivation to play the game again. For a game that is clearly made with multiple playthroughs in mind... well, that's saying something. \n\nSo don't buy this game yet, but wait for fixes and updates. The game has so many good ideas going for it, but I can't help but to feel like it's maybe one of those soups with too many cooks. More narrowed focus on singular aspects rather than trying to tackle so many things at once would have probably worked better for a game like this.

So far it isn't. \nIt has good music and the art looks great. But that's about it. \nSpoilers Ahead.\n\nThe design is really clunky. Here's a bunch of stuff that has come to my mind while writing this:\n- There's no point for the time clock, you don't feel a pressure since there's not a global counter like on XCOM and the time passes fast. But it's pointless.\n- The different parts of the city are pretty far, and travelling between those is not very straightforward. The map scrolling changes from street to map view, and rotates the more you scroll away, that can be confusing. Should I run? Take a cab? Am I losing something by doing one or another. Time? Money? It's not clear.\n- The buildings you raze get occupied after a couple of weeks(?) -they do actually get occupied pretty fast- so it feels like a continuous stream of the same pointless fight against the same thugs for meager loot.\n- The costs of having another building of the same type raise after each local is bought. It's clearly by design, but it's not very realistic and it's not explained why.\n- On XCOM 2 and even on Chimera Squad there was a pressure to get missions done, to delay the counter or to take down a faction. Here the character runs around followed by his goons without any direction. Time passes while you take building after building. Running rampant since Bosses are OP and the other bosses aren't around to fight.\n- The map has minor side quests that are somewhat hidden and most of the times bugged.\n- You can sell your weapons for money. That's not explained on the tutorial, But I'm pretty sure 75% of my earnings came from selling weapons.\n- The AI is really bad. Fights are not fun and everything feels very repetive. \n- The \"Mafia Alliances\" system doesn't make much sense. You will chat with other bosses, exchange some percentage of stuff which isn't very impactful and others will mettle. You can fight one boss, join him later, broke a deal, break it. In the span of a couple of Thug buildings being razed. There's no sense or direction to it.\n\nThe game feels like a poorly conceived hybrid. Or a game that was released on Early Access.\nIt's like they decided to use the fight system from XCOM2, but without the AI. \nThe conversational system of Civilization but without having any meaningful decision.\nThe building system of a strategy mobile game, but without any logic behind.\nAnd the monetary system of an ARPG, but without it's rewards.\n\nI never felt like a mob boss, or a gangster. I felt like Mario running from one building to another. What's the point of having a safe house if you're never there? If this was a conceived as a simulation it has failed. And if it's not, then it also failed, because it's not fun to play.\n\nI work on the game industry, so I know it's not easy to make games. \nBut I'd rather have waited a couple of months for a product that feels finished and it's fun to play than this pantomime of a game.", "timestamp_created": 1607547820, "timestamp_updated": 1607548294, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129016876220703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81911267": {"recommendationid": "81911267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198848375745", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 501, "last_played": 1611303537}, "language": "english", "review": "Just completed the game with Al-Capone; Great gameplay with proper strategic planning requirement.

Possibilities are endless and it will probably meet most expectations in the future.\n\nOn the other side, sadly, this game is bugged to the level which will be untoreable to most players, or dissapointing  at least. Bugged quests, that can miss element required to finish them. Bugged fights, which can't proceed to the second turn or end due to enemies not loading on the map (can be ended only by loading a save). Bugged graphics, where model animations freezes, movement range and accuracy display vanishes, abilities grey-out even when they are usable. Bugged mechanics, where neighbourhood status lock's itself in poorest or highest prosperity rating, other mobster's pay you cash for alcohol You don't have, bussines agreements are constantly broken by AI without any reason, even just after singning them.

The economy once figured out mainly circulates around having well off breweries and investing heavily in keeping a good stock of booze. You have three ways to make money Speak Easies, Brothels, and Casinos. The first two scale with upgrades which are expensive and honestly are rarely worth the time investment. Casinos make money on an RNG factor and can sometimes break and net you a crazy amount of money if you scale them all the way up though they are frankly useless early on. Though you can pretty much ignore all of this since any game can be ended within an hour since capturing enemies\u2019 breweries will kill their economy and you can just invest in guards and snowball the game from there. The diplomacy system is there but rarely if ever nets you any serious gain and killing an enemy faction is too easy to do. Declare war, Assault Safe house, Murder enemy boss, and now you own their empire and your economy is through the roof. Why pay for upgrades and wait when you can just lose your small business and kill their leader and get them all back and more.

The player, AI team members and AI opponents missing pointblank with shotguns (full length and sawed off) while their adversary is under no form of cover and in the square right next to them; or 6 melee attacks with a bat in a row with not a single hit... all while the AI with a pistol just runs from one point of the building to another without shooting... while that could be realistic it's highly improbable.

hoping this game would be a bit more similar to the Gangster games WAY back.\nSadly this was not the case, the game can be fun but its very shallow in terms of management (booze + casino's and you are pretty much done).\n\nThe relationship are a nice touch and how they can negate negative traits over time is a nice mechanic.\nThe fact that they can fall in love with each other because they are working with each other is a thing, however it seems this happens a lot and this makes the male on male love frequent.\n\nThe role gimmick is nice but also shallow, I mean the structure of the Mob is very important but in this game its a gimmick, i mean, come on.\n\nAll the sitdowns are pretty much the same, also you can't skip the text (at least that i found) and this makes it slow and tiresome.\n\nYou sometimes get a message that a racket is under attack, you can fight or abandon (meaning you lose the fight) the racket.\nFighting means minutes of tedious combat between some guards which seems to even miss shotgun shots up close.\nAt least the outer fights you can abandon, but once they are inside the racket you HAVE to fight the battles, meaning even if its 5 against 2, again wasted time and tedious.\nThey should have an auto resolve feature for this BS in the game or something that you can call in your gangsters to the spot to make it a bit less boring and tedious.\n\nMissions are OK.\n\nThe bosses are nicely done but some of the sound effects for their special ability are cringe, in such a way I just muted the sound completely to not hear them (especially since you will use the ability a lot).\nThey mus have thought it was funny to use these type of sound effects but they break immersion and are cringe.\n\nThe abilities of the different bosses are not balanced at all, some you can one shot 3 NPC's others you can't even kill 1 NPC, I get that not all abilities are meant to be the killing sort but if I can take out 3 NPC's with 1 ability compared to damaging 1 NPC, il take the first option every time.\n\nThen we have the bugs, Jesus there are a lot of game breaking bugs.\nSome are already patched but since I bought the game on release they are part of my experience.\n\nA small list so far:\n\n- Corrupt saves (They fixed this recently)\n- Due to a bug all upgrades costs are 0 (seems you ended up in a debug mode or something )( This was also fxied recently).\n- Characters getting stuck in combat animations making you have to reload the game and start the fight over again.\n- Mission NPC's that just crash, no interaction possible, so you can't complete the mission and since the are set up as a mini story with multiple missions you simply can't finish the sequence of missions anymore.\nYou also can't restart the missions its pretty much end of the line.\nOne mission I tried to fast travel to a different location and back to see if that fixed anything, NPC was just GONE, abducted by aliens or something.\nSave and load also does not work in these situations.\n- Next bug, during combat i executed a melee action and the character was stuck in the action.\nReloading the last save and i noticed that in my melee slot there was a handgun, open the melee slot and i could not equip handguns, only melee weapons, so thats what i did.\nStarted the fight, same result, stuck in melee action.\nPerformed the same action with selecting the melee weapon instead of the handgun in my inventory.\nAfter a while i noticed it switched back to a handgun again and the melee weapon got warped into another dimension because i could not find it anywhere.\n- Another bug, might be related to the above but who knows at this point.\nDuring combat you have an action ribbon you can use to select your action to perform.\nI noticed that all my items were displayed even though i could only equip 2 in the inventory, this made the ribbon really long making the default attack action appear under my character badge causing some problems.\nI did not dare to select any of the items because this might break the game again.\n- Another bug, selected the shotgun blast ability, cancelled the action because i wanted to perform a different action and all the sudden the shotgun action button duplicated itself in the action ribbon.\n- There was also the time were 1 of my gangsters decided to walk everywhere (no he was not drunk) instead of running, just out of the blue he started walking everywhere, ok maybe 1 or 2 times he actually ran but still, WTH.\n- Asked (nicely) that my boss and his gangters move to a certain area on the map but they simply would not, the area contained rackets from the same district so they should be able to go there, but no , nothing happened.\nLuckily i already explored the area at some point so I could fast travel, but yeah.\n- All the other bugs I simply forgot.\n\nGamerelease 2020:\nOur game is done somewhere in the area of 40% to 90%, lets ship it, give us money and maybe we will patch it to a workable state after a few months when everybody is already done with the game and / or finished it (assuming they can in the state the games are in these days).\n\nAt

I love the topic of Great Depression, so everything was set to meet the game.\nAnd this drove me even to a bigger disappointment when actually playing the game.\n\nThere are still so many nice things:\n- Many game with different features\n- Atmospheric dialogues exposing the personalities\n- The items and weapons are done so much with love and preciseness\n- Tons of statistics and dashboards to overview your empire\n\nBut it's gameplay and its routine that are annoying:\n- The other fractions are continuously calling you for a sitdown with short lead-time and long dialogues which unfortunately lead to a super minor outcome, like casino maintenance decreased by 4% (!) Well, maybe you can ignore them and reject the sitdowns.? Yes, you can. But the other fraction will immediately decrease their perception of you. At the end you find yourself running continuously from sitdown to sitdown.\n- The other fractions can ask you to supply 0.234587154896423 (!) items of alcohol.\n- The alcohol is shown by somewhat similar icons but in dialogues it called by name so you need to remember what is what. Same with fractions: you are in business agreement with \"orange fraction\". Then another fraction comes and invites you to fight vs Ragen. Will you agree? What if orange fraction is Ragen? This you cannot check during the dialogue, you need to answer blindly.\n- The alcohol preferences are strange: a city (all together!) switches to some type of alcohol ignoring the price ups and downs. How can it be?! This drives you to switch production at your breweries every time it happens or try to produce a lot to the stock to simply avoid this irritative action in the game.\n- You can rename the people but not your casinos! (you can only give a name at acquisition) Strange, right? This makes very difficult to remember the buildings. Later, when one of the buildings is being attacked you can only imagine where it was.\n- Battle targeting system is very unsustainable. You sometimes need many attempts to finally confirm the aim.\n- Battle locations are always the same.\n- Weapon system is misbalanced. Any moment you can find a super gun that will solve easily any battle. Why to buy them from the black market for x10 price then?\n- A relation overview is strongly needed. You can only review it fraction by fraction for the time being.\n\nSo for the time being I would wait to buy the game.

These kinds of games somewhat defined a mafioso experience at least from an RTS context. This game is effectively, take Omerta, change it up a little bit and ship it. These are the following reasons why I am glad that CD key websites exist:\n\n1. The economy is an absolute shambles. \n\nYou only have 3 options of making money:\n\n- Own a business (brothel, casino or speakeasy) and then supply those businesses from your breweries, and increase customers using hotels. There is no mediation. What happened to protection racketeering for local businesses? Money laundering through legal fronts? What happened to gambling dens? Prize fighting? Numbers games? Counterfeiting Press? The difference between Breweries and Liquor for the time period? Doing independent trade from external groups? Empowering minor groups to become major groups to get some vassals or even integrate them into your own gang?\n\n- Go ransack or kill a bunch of people in the derelict buildings that basically becomes a joke when you do it over and over again, and it's just totally boring.\n\n- Or, go and buy all the swill from all the gangs, and sell it to the minor ones and pretend it is whiskey for a whopping 0 relationship penalty. Something that really should have been playtested.\n\n2. The combat is boooooriiiiing.\n\nImagine taking a turn based X-COM like fighting system and instead of allowing troops to carry a backpack you just let them have a couple of tiny extras, that really are just grenades or some form of explosive, that is really useless and only affects 2 squares (no shrapnel or minor damaged based on distance to grenade), a primary that really is either just terrible or ridiculously OP, e.g. characters that can use machine guns from the start vs characters that use shotguns. The only shotguns and pistols that are worthwhile are the uniques and the ultra rare ones you get after annihilating the pointless AI safehouses that you can just sit back and overwatch until they run into your hail of bullets and heal your guys with doctors if they stick even a single shot on you. \n\nNot to mention the most bland gangsters I've ever seen with some of them even having the -wrong- voices, e.g. an old woman sounding like an Irish young adult. Why did nobody bugtest this?\n\nAnd last but not least, the leveling system is pointless as you would -never- use half the skills as they just don't do anything to help you in the long run for the character to actually improve. There is no point in training characters to use a different type of weapon considering the combat is so bland and boring. You can just sit and wait for them to come to you and overwatch around corners even while attacking safehouses. Always buy doctors and hired guns as there is no point in anyone else as they can't either heal or do enough damage. The demolitionists are absolutely pointless because they just destroy things permanently which causes a whole heap of nothing. The enforcers are pointless unless you send them in as a mole into another gang.\n\nWhich reminds me, another thing about Moles. What's the point of them? I can just annihilate the entire gang and I -never- see any of their gangsters in combat until I hit their safehouses. What's the point of the enemy even having gangsters for that matter. \n\nWhy is it also in these kinds of games I have to drag my mob boss around like some form of dog on a leash when I could send some chump AI to go attack different places while I prepare attacks in the right places where it would be needed? Like massive breweries my opponents would -definitively- send in troops to protect hugely. Why do I have to attack -every- business which has 3 low level chumps in?\n\n3. The diplomacy is pointless.\n\nActually, scratch that. The diplomacy is pointless besides the exploitable bug where I can just sell a massive amount of swill pretending to be whiskey to minor factions to make money. Honor means absolutely nothing considering all of the enemies even on the hardest difficulty are so ridiculously easy to kill. \n\nWhy do you HAVE to sitdown with everybody you meet? What's the point? They offer you a business association at the start and then demand you to not be in a business association afterwards with the next man. It's almost as if the game needs to force you to make these decisions in order to manufacture some idea of conflict for no reason.\n\nLast thing is, why can't I change the time duration and why is the day \"time\" just so arbitrary?\n\nOverall, don't buy this.

No building stills and buying trucks to move hooch to the docks or your watering holes. No buying cars and weapons to tool up your hit squad for a drive by hit on a rival boss. No tailing his mooks to locate their head quarters and planning to dynamite it.\nLook at the string of things you could do to build your Empire on a game that ran on Windows 5 and 250 Mb of memory. Now consider this offering:\nNo flavour, no atmosphere no Team or resource management to get your teeth into. Just four building types and selling various grades of liquor - to other Gangsters. Oh who cares? \nTurn based combat is based on \"Omerta City of Gangsters\" and is fairly facile. It is just dull and repetitive - I lost interest very quickly. I could live with a whole lot less chrome and with a lot more detailed management , money making options and atmosphere.

Then I played the game. \n\nTLDR: Overall my initial reactions are the game is a really shallow experience.\n \nThat empire management stuff and the economic systems in play are very shallow in particular. After combat you get to take over the buildings. There is little to no difference between the rackets though. When it asks you what you want it to be there is really only three choices. They each make you money, some more than others, they each have an upkeep mechanic you gotta pay, and that's about it. No difference between the three (Speakeasy / Brothel / Casino) though and you can literally spam only one type and be just fine. \n\nThe Breweries are needed or you won't make any money in your Speakeasies. They need you to supply them with alcohol. You can trade excess booze for cash too which is a broken exploit right now because you can disguise it as Whiskey. \n\nFrom there you just spend the cash you make on more speakeasies (or upgrades) to make more money until you need more booze. And do the cycle again and again. It always seems to be the same repeat. Not a lot of depth here. \n\nIt think the game's economy would be way more interesting if there was some kind of supply and demand system that is more robust than the preferred booze type that changes each month. Where if say your neighborhood of Chicago was oversaturated with speakeasies then it would become harder to attract customers and booze would have to be sold cheaper. Which means lower profits if you invest in only speakeasies. It would incentivize players to then try to monopolize a particular business in that neighborhood and cut out the competition maybe choosing brothels, casinos, or something else instead of a speakeasy. \n\nHotels bring in more customers and double your synergies. If you have say three of a kind of the same racket type they give you like a 10% bonus. I think you can only have one Hotel per neighborhood though. \n\nThe other thing you spend your cash on is hiring henchmen. Though the combat is so dull you really don't need a full 10/10.\n\nThe game revolves around the combat and that isn't even all that special. The maps are tiny first of all. The combat is over in a matter of turns even when you're trying to take down a bosses safehouse. This is because the OP boss abilities. The other major flaw to the combat is the lack of environmental interactions. They are virtually non-existent. You would think people would be climbing over benches or vehicles to scramble to get out of the way of a gun fight that just broke out. And the player could be using the vehicles or other things in the environment as explosions or using explosives to destroy cover. It's very basic half cover, full cover, and flanking the enemy. Half the time there is no penalty to just running up next to them to get 100% and the kill but leaving yourself outside of cover. The AI is not very good. \n\nAnd when you kill a boss the game doesn't even replace the dead with procedural generated one, or even lesser factions. One would expect some lesser criminal would at least try to take up and assume the mantle and seize control in that power vacuum. \n\nI honestly think the combat is a step back from previous games in this genre. Instead of improving upon games like XCOM or Gears Tactics even Empire of Sin just does the bare minimum. The characters ( think xcom soldiers) do have classes and each class has different abilities you can choose in the skill trees but there is a lot of overlapping abilities even amongst the classes. \n   \nThey badly need an auto resolve function for the combat because you'll get sucked into repetitive fights back to back to back when you're trying to manage your empire and forced to fight as your guards. I don't mind this every now and then I would even choose to fight the fight but you have no choice. It's every time you gotta go in and fight the fight.\n\nAlso they really need a better way to compare weapons. Since your constantly upgrading and changing it's not a fun experience.  The UI functions and information is actually really shoddy. For being a strategy game and a Paradox published game you would expect more. Half the time I was scrolling over symbols and couldn't find a way to tell what it did or explain it and where i was getting it from. Not even a name to let me know what it was. Did I mention there is no manual even?\n\nI haven't even encountered any of the game breaking bugs reportedly out there either. \n\nThe game is just a hot mess but there's hope that they'll fix it in that it just released and by and large it's been negatively received by the community. They got to do something. \n\nWhat do I like about the game? I love the setting and the theme. The time period of prohibition-era mobster ran Chicago has always been a fun time to play around in. The violence and intrigue of backstabbing and killing former partners in crime. The musical score is pretty good too.  It has a lot of style going for it and you can tell it was a labor of love for at least some of the devs. The game has it's potential but that's where my praise for this game ends. The theme alone doesn't even come close to outweighing the issues I have with it's design or mechanics.

I never learned a third (or higher) skill on any character before beating the game and only got a 1st and 2nd by dragging ass and exploring all the non-content trying to find a use for it\n-Enemies never get any stronger, only 1-3 people during boss fights don't die in one rifle shot on the hardest difficulty\n\nAnd now a short list of the systems in this game that don't do anything and should be ignored, as it's as useful to you winning as playing cookie clicker on your other monitor.\n\nManaging customer draw and capacity at owned places\nManaging tier of booze dependent on sector prosperity\nDeciding which building to make for highest profits\nManaging sector prosperity by building quality\nManaging your threat level versus other factions\nTrying to not draw police attention (I shot every cop and never did anything to hide and they never did anything about it)\nManaging relations with other factions\nBalancing security against likelihood to be raided (you never get raided, minimum security can beat any actual attack if you decide to not teleport and kill all 3 attackers with your Main Character)\nHiring troops based on bonuses, traits and relationships\nInstalling troops in businesses to increase building statistics slightly\nQuests\n", "timestamp_created": 1607450777, "timestamp_updated": 1607450777, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539363503456115723", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81850154": {"recommendationid": "81850154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089200105", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1597, "last_played": 1617155151}, "language": "english", "review": "So this game has alot of promise.

There's really no point, imo, in having all these different mob bossses because you most likely won't have any reason to play the game again after you beat it with one, which is very easy to do. Maybe a mob boss custom creator would have been better.\n\nThe variability of named gangsters would be cool if there was more you could do with them. As it stands, they're mostly only used for the turn-based combat, and half the gangsters don't visually fit in with this role. Moreover, the way they're scaled in price makes it inefficient to pay for the more expensive ones. You'd only do it for flavor. Guns are vastly more important than stats from what I can see, and they're beyond easy to get.\n\nIf you want, you can just immediately start taking out enemy safehouses. You automatically absorb all that faction's rackets into your empire when you kill the boss. Pretty quickly, you get to this point where you're like... well, okay, I'm the strongest now... okay... uh, nothing more to do except dump cash into my rackets. I did this within 20 hours of playing the game, and that includes probably five hours of trying out different bosses in the beginning. Frankie Donovan is absolutely overpowered and makes the fights easier than normal.\n\nAnyway, if they fixed the many bugs and polished some of the mechanics, added some flavor, maybe widened the selection of gangsters and gave them more to do, then this could be a good game.

All there is to it is you go through a dialog where the two characters insult each other, and the end is either you make a deal, or you don\u2019t. When you take a deal all you gain is some discount on upgrades. I have not encountered anything else other than that.\n\n[*]Then the annoying and constant reminder that the preference of the neighbourhood has changed. You\u2019re in the middle of something and up pops this info box.\n\n[*] The variety in enemies are also very noticeable. Apart from that what is very annoying is the fact that half the of the guards are females that look like male. Now I have never seen a mafia movie where any guards where female. They where all men. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t have anything against females. But this was purely driven by political transparency and to satisfy liberal politics. Politics should be kept out of games. [b]Stay true to the facts[/b].\n\n[*] The AI is stupid. Characters will come right up to the enemy and reload, without any AP left. To name but one example.\n[/olist]\nSo, this is where I will end my thoughts on Empire of Sin. There are more but I want to keep it as short as possible.\n\nSo, do I recommend Empire of Sin? This is a borderline case. Was it not for the game constantly freezing I could have maybe recommended it regardless of the BUGS. But this game needs a lot of work in my opinion. Until then I give it a NO. Very disappointing after such a long wait.\n\n[u]Edit Review - 2020-12-19[/u]\nSo I didn't play Empire of Sin for a few days. Started it up today and the following issues occurred:\n[olist]\n[*] I cannot complete missions, Why? Because all activity on screen cease. AI moves around but I cannot interact with the characters in order to complete missions. I click onscreen but playable characters don't move.\n[*] I cannot access the menu when pressing the escape key. This means I cannot save my game.\n[/olist]", "timestamp_created": 1607441048, "timestamp_updated": 1608414343, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52649003267288208", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81841507": {"recommendationid": "81841507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023155762", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1174, "last_played": 1617111226}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game I followed with much anticipation for months on end. I love this time period, I love this kind of game. I have waited for a game like this for a very long time, but it is a niche game for a niche audience. I know there was a lot of expectations for this to be better than it is, to be strategically deep and have deep management options. I will say that what is there may not be incredibly deep, but it's not overwhelming either. I really feel like this is something that will improve with time, the foundation is good and it's something that the developers and community can really build on like our own empire together. \n\nI would like to see some things in the future though that aren't currently there such as the ability to send goons out to attack rackets. The AI can do this, why can't I? It's a little less gang feeling and more of a \"Kill Squad\" with how it is right now. I should be able to send out a group of goons maybe led by a gangster sort of like how The Godfather 2 was. I would also like to see what's known as \"Fronts\", there's only the specific rackets and they aren't really hidden the way I thought they would be like a backroom sort of thing. The last thing I can really think of is proper extortion rackets. I mean yes, the AI minor factions and even the other bosses will pay you protection money but there's just something about having a business that is legit paying money to you as a boss and it feels more like a territory thing. A little more business expansion than just the few rackets that we have would really help fill this game out.\n\nAt the end of the day though, this game is solid and I feel like it will expand with good feedback. We as a community have to show the developers why we love this time period, why we love this kind of game. I know that I love it already despite being a little less than even I expected. I know that I can sink a lot of time into this and will continue to watch it over time with great interest. When mod support comes out, I think the community will help out as well. I can't recommend this game for everyone, but I can to those who love this era, love strategy and management, or any combination of these few things. Empire of Sin is something that I think a lot of people like me have wanted for a long time and with a little guidance it will become more of the game that we've dreamed of.

Also what makes me mad the most if they have not admitted the disappointing state of this game only talking about more DLC that we will have to pay for an test for them. \n\nLet me also add they are not releasing patches quick enough because this is a game released on console as well.  So expect this not to be playable within the next 6 months since they are releaseing patches for both console and PC at the same time.  \n\nBe warned if you purchase this game you will be finding bugs causing you to restart at your last save which is 30 mins average of play through.  \n\nWait on buying (my only recommendation).\n\nIt will be a good game just not right now.

March into an enemy faction leader's safehouse at any time, and if you can win the fight, their empire is yours. \n\nCombat is simplistic, and is seldom more than running behind the closest piece of cover, spaming AOE, multitarget effects, and basic attacks until everybody on the other team is dead. It really could have just saved time and cut the tactical system out in favor of a JRPG line up and exchange blows system. \n\nWhen not in combat, or deciding which one of your rackets you are going to give a marginal upgrade to, your party walks around the city, running from quest giver to quest giver. Missions are usually \"go kill this guy\" or \"go kill all those guys\" or \"go inside a building and interact with an object\". Faction leaders and hired characters will have quest lines associated with them, and I appreciate the effort to give the characters a little hand crafted depth, but rarely does anything get away from \"go there and shoot someone\". \n\nOverall I would have been fine with the simulation part being so weak if the tactical battles were the least bit interesting (or vice versa) but as it stands this game doesn't really do anything well.", "timestamp_created": 1607381813, "timestamp_updated": 1607381813, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81806716": {"recommendationid": "81806716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309788895", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 602, "last_played": 1608351125}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is bug ridden and it would literally won't allow you to continue your progress.

I wanted to like it, and did enjoy it initially. There was something fun about going into a building and cleaning it of thugs. I ran through the game on normal mode in about 15 hours. I built a squad with two doctors in it, and the rest were enforcers or hired guns. I equipped everyone with rifles or sniper rifles. On normal mode, metal lined waist coats and vests dropped often enough that my whole squad - 9 people in all - were all well equipped. I lost a couple squad members along the way, but was quickly taking over safe houses and claiming entire mob empires.\n\nSo, I tried it on hard mode. Good armor drops were less frequent, and the mobs in safe houses were more difficult; but, the major let down is the fact that combat is so redundant. Enter. Seek cover. Shoot the most likely target, or use the special ability, or set the character into over-watch. Rifles and sniper rifles, especially anything above common, are often one-shot killers. On the most difficult setting, you get attacked more often in your enterprises. That, too, is a let down. You can't equip individual employees, so holding enterprises is a matter of sheer numbers, as they're often way under powered or under equipped compared to the attackers. I ended up just abandoning the encounter and taking my squad to the safe house of the attacking faction and eliminating them. Sometimes you can't abandon the encounter, and your forced to go through the combat motions even though you know you'll lose.\n\nAs to squads: the inter-personal dynamics are kind of fun at first. Squad members fall in love with each other completely disregarding gender, and sometimes will go into a unique combat mode if their lover is hit. It breaks combat too easily. Too often these hardened gangsters that you've spent time leveling up to unlock unique skills flee out the door as soon as their lover or friend falls dead.\n\nEmpire and enterprise management is achieved through leveling up features of enterprises. That's it. Just click the button and in a set time the security or ambiance or whatever improves. You have no other control. \n\nNearly 25 hours in and I won't be jumping back into this game unless there are significant changes. This isn't an early access release, remember.

How this has been released in this state is completely puzzling.\n\nMaybe some day it will grow up to be a real game, but right now this is just throwing money out the window.", "timestamp_created": 1607367268, "timestamp_updated": 1607367268, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81796561": {"recommendationid": "81796561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039378976", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 591, "last_played": 1607366161}, "language": "english", "review": "To be blunt, the game is boring. Like a lot of other people have said it has potential, but as it is, it's at best a bit boring and at worst a slog to get through.\n\nSome of the problems are a question of UI, which could be easily fixed. For example, the city is divided into neighbourhoods, and you have multiple businesses in each neighbourhood. There is a screen where you can see all of your businesses in that neighbour, but if you want to make changes to them you have to go into a different screen for the individual business and lose sight of the state of the neighbourhood over all.\n\nThe combat is kind of fun, sometimes, but a lot of battles are so one-sided it's just annoying that you have to do them at all.\n\nThere aren't enough gangsters to hire. I don't care about their depth or complexity. There just need to be more, and you need to be able to hire more, and the AI needs to hire more. Even in the late game you'll have a squad of 10, and the AI *might* have as many as 2. You'll only see them if you attack their HQ though. Also you can have one of them as a lieutenant to govern your businesses in a neighbourhood, but they only apply a small bonus, and there are 6 neighbourhoods and you can only hire 10. So using them as anything other than a hit squad is a waste of time.\n\nThe battles when the enemy attacks you are just boring. You either win in an absolute grind, because your basic guards are rubbish, but so are the units they attack with, or you just accept losing and then retake it two seconds later with your squad.\n\nSome effort has gone into the streetscape, but it's wasted because you never really look at it. You move your units around mostly from the zoomed out view.\n\nThe controls in the city view are awful. There's no button to zoom on a character, so if you've stopped controlling one you need to go look for him across the whole city to get control again. Similarly, when it comes to looking for your enemies' stronghold, you need to check each individual neighbourhood, because there's no button to just show where they are.\n\nThere's only one way to win the game. You take over all the other factions' territory, but you can do that just by attacking their HQ and then you get all of their businesses. I played around for a bit, then decided to go do that to everyone one at a time and I took the whole city in about 2 hours.\n\nI was hoping for a game like Gangsters: Organized Crime, but this is not it.

Is it genuinely terrible or is it just lacking enough polish that turns into a vapid experience?\n\n\ud83d\udd39Welcome to 1920 Chicago. You assume control of one of several crime bosses inspired by real-life mobsters in the US prohibition era. Your one and only goal as the head of the family is to expand your empire by taking out the competition and be the last boss to reign over the city.\n\n[h3]Rating: Decent[/h3]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2282929825]Click here for the complete Rating Chart[/url]\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[th][h3]Hit[/h3][/th]\n\t[th][h3]Miss[/h3][/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]\u2714\ufe0fText-based dilemmas that have small consequences over time\n\u2714\ufe0fEnticing atmosphere and setting about the US prohibition era\n\u2714\ufe0fWide array of bosses to choose from, each having unique abilities and traits\n\u2714\ufe0fCombat proves to be incredibly fun when AI is working as intended\n\u2714\ufe0fOverview of the city map is distinctively colored, making it easy to find what you're looking for\n\u2714\ufe0fVisuals and soundtrack truly embrace the roaring '20s[/td]\n\t[td]\u274cTutorial barely scratches the surface, leaving many of the more advanced mechanics under explained\n\u274cDiplomacy is almost useless, given how often AI turns against you \n\u274cDifficulty is lackluster and unchallenging unless playing on the highest settings\n\u274cSometimes, combat can be a drag due to wooden AI\n\u274cAI characters are mostly clones of each other\n\u274cRecycled assets throughout the city but not enough to ruin the immersion\n\u274cvoice acting fails to capture the gravity of the sit-downs accompanied by dull and repeated animations[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\ud83d\udd39I have included my [b]full elaboration of the cons[/b] in an external document due to the character limit. You can find it [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/16GlSb5FzGsuGzeuN_9qZ5vX9um_1V8Be8VRvoHdi9MM/edit?usp=sharing]here.[/url]\n\n[h2][b]Gangster melodrama[/b][/h2]\nUpon arriving in the city, you're nothing but a low-life thug in Chicago despite having fame attached to your name. You must gain a solid foothold by taking over rackets and retain it by going all out on illicit businesses and shady deals, all while Feds are breathing down your neck and mob families waiting for a misstep.\n\nYou'll encounter numerous scripted missions as well as randomly triggered ones while trying to acquire new rackets by either paying a hefty amount of cash up-front or swiping them from someone else. The missions consist of straightforward errands for your family or text-based dilemmas. The choices typically fall into the villainous or benevolent categories, so they're not that nuanced but sometimes the roleplaying options do offer a bit more flexibility.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2312207225\n[h2][b]Live large and carry a big gun[/b][/h2]\nThe gameplay is divided into three parts: RPG, combat, and empire management. To begin your crime life, you must choose one of the fourteen bosses, each having their own particular set of traits and skills with a touch of small backstories to diversify them further. The same goes for the huge pool of brazen gangsters available to hire on-demand. Gangsters work in one of the five professions: Con artists, doctors, enforcers, hired guns, and demolitionists each with a somewhat unique talent tree to take advantage of during combat.\n\nHow you handle the rivals and your own crew very much shapes how you rise as a boss. Meanwhile, you gain notoriety by taking over rackets, completing missions, and taking out enemies. Higher notoriety allows you to hire bigger-shot gangsters. As nifty as it sounds, AI fails to behave accordingly and ends up breaking out wars on you for no reason.\n\nBut to be fair, the turn-based combat proves to be incredibly fun when AI is working as intended. Planning out your moves and making the most of your mobsters' abilities are crucial to turn the tides of the war in your favor, even though it feels lackluster, unchallenging, and sometimes can be a drag no matter what difficulty settings are chosen.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2312215047\nDuring Chicago's prohibition era, alcohol is liquid gold. Continuous injection of booze into your businesses must be maintained so breweries are the key to keep them in a functional state. While your workers are busy supplying your empire with the hooch, you have several options to amp your earnings higher. Establishing speakeasies, casinos, and brothels will make sure you would have a steady income, while hotels increase the number of customers in each neighborhood.\n\nMoreover, to assure having a long-lasting criminal empire, different aspects of your rackets must be improved. Upgrading defense and deflect allows you to repel gang attacks and police raids. Ambiance spruces up the place that directly impacts the racket's draw. Lastly, word of mouth attracts more customers to your place. The upgrades as well as your empire's statistics are presented through text-laden menus that mostly feel like a burden to read through.\n\n[h2][b]The roaring twenties[/b][/h2]\n[u][b]Visual[/b][/u]\nI went in for EoS completely blindly and I was surprised by how pleasing the aesthetics are, given it runs on Unity engine. Different corners of the city are sometimes recycled assets, yet they are amazingly detailed. Characters are of high quality and have sharp textures that help to make these gangsters (but not all of them) more believable. UI is given nuance with an eye-catchy black and gold theme if you don't mind all the texts that clutter it.\n\n[u][b]Sounds[/b][/u]\nThe jazz-mixed soundtrack is the exact tune and tempo one would expect from such a crime setting. It's coupled with a rather modernistic piano and trumpet pieces that truly embraces the roaring '20s style.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2312224928\n[h3]Technical[/h3]\n\ud83d\udd39[b][u]Specs[/u][/b]\ud83d\udd39\n[u]GTX1050 2GB - Athlon II X4 645 - 8GB DDR3 RAM[/u]\nThe game runs with all settings maxed out, using about 70% of VRAM at 1680x1050 60 FPS.\n\n\ud83d\udd39[b][u]Bugs & Issues[/u][/b]\ud83d\udd39\nTwo updates have already rolled out fixing some of the minor and major bugs. I've been informed the balance issues are addressed and under view. \n[list]\n    [*]During combat inside buildings, allies spawn in random places despite entering from the door\n    [*]On occasions, conquering rackets early on might void the later missions tied to those specific rackets\n    [*]Under certain conditions, the AI can be quite aggressive and engage the player repeatedly in a war.\n    [*]Characters occasionally get bugged and skate across the floor, stalling the combat and animations for a short time\n\n[/list]\n\n[h2][b]The bottom line[/b][/h2]\n\ud83d\udd39I have honestly enjoyed EoS on its core gameplay level as I don't look for a challenging experience in my first playthroughs. Bringing [b]XCOM[/b]'s turn-based gameplay to the underbelly of a criminal empire is a unique and somewhat underappreciated setting that we should see more of it. However, its technical ricketiness gets in the way of many things it attempts to do well.\n\n\ud83d\udd39There's no campaign, only a sandbox mode where the \"kill or be killed\" rule applies. Although, the number of present bosses and neighborhoods can dramatically affect each session length up to a dozen hours. I can see myself getting 100+ hours out of EoS in the near future but regrettably, given all the game design imperfections, it's not everyone's cup of tea.\nI can only recommend buying it at half the price or wait until it's polished out.\n\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7871885/]Follow our curator page,[b] OCG-Curations[/b], if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1607366661, "timestamp_updated": 1607761009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 71, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688050687313079834", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81795420": {"recommendationid": "81795420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041112321", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1607364840}, "language": "english", "review": "This game reminds me of a very old mafia game.

Lastly if you got enough money, bribe the cops to improve relations and get them on your side as they can be allies in the street shootouts as well as to leave your businesses alone but the FBI? that's a whole different story.\n\nWatch this youtuber, ChristopherOdd.

If you want to win you hire two or three guys and immediately kill off the competitors whilst taking over all of their business.\n\nThe economy of the game is weird to say the least... There is alcohol and that's kind of it. It feels like the economy is not working at all, Everything is so complicated, more so with the chosen UI, dialog windows pop in over each other interrupting whatever you are doing. Long story short, it is a mess, a chaos.\n\nI am happy to change my review if the devs decide to address oh so many issues and finally finish the game, but as of right now, I cannot recommend this game and I am sorry for that.", "timestamp_created": 1607358464, "timestamp_updated": 1607358464, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81788775": {"recommendationid": "81788775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046086875", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 946, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 946, "last_played": 1607305480}, "language": "english", "review": "I completed my playthrough on standard settings: 10 neighborhoods, 10 faction leaders, middle difficulty.\n\nI found the game to be buggy and tedious.

Empire of Sin is fun but it has glaring issues and suffers from serious repetition. I'll be honest, I was never expecting to play a new game led (sort of) by the legendary John Romero. Y'know. The dude that formed Id Software. The DOOM guys? Anyway playing a game that was spearheaded by him and his wife is definitely cool but god is this game buggy. I've had entire quests break the game. An example of this would be a quest with Jacques regarding a month long absence of breweries. When it was completed my breweries were still closed and were unable to be opened forcing me to either restart or sell them and start from scratch. Some gang member quests are also broken. Whenever a war breaks out good luck having a moments peace. Once a war breaks out it's constant attacks that halt the games flow forcing you to enter fights with the enemy despite \"abandoning\" them. It gets frustrating when you're trying to do something and every couple of seconds you're forced to fight. Combat wise it's fine. The turn based combat lends itself well to the kind of game. It actually reminds me a lot of Omerta. But it does get boring having to go from building to building shooting thugs just to get property but I can understand how this would make sense but I do feel like an automated feature of sending canon fodder gang members to wipe out these buildings would be good. Also. I do wish the game was a little...gorier? I mean come on I curb stomp people and it's just a little splash of blood. Overall I enjoy Empire of Sin. I have 50hrs tracked at the moment I don't intend to stop playing anytime soon. The games appeal is definitely charming and the diverse cast of gang leaders alone is great and I intend to play as all of them.

I have to say YES.\n\nThat said the game for me currently sits at a sold 6/10, which does not seem to be high after spending \u00a341.99, but there is enough to take away from this game that is good. Having read some of the negative reviews, I can't say that I totally agree with their points of view, although there are one or two things that do ring true.\n\nThe good bits.\n1: The game feels authentic to the period, the environment feels authentic to the period, so yea well done to the devs in bringing the 1920s to life. Graphics are good and sound too.\n\n2: The story starts at the beginning of the notorious lives of the characters such as Al Capone. Some have argued that its boring all the running around and does not feel authentic. well what people fail to realise is that in the 1920s (just watch Boardwalk Empire) people like Al Capone were nobodies, it took years for them to build up their reputations and power. People like Capone did a lot of the grunt work until such time he could get people to do the work for him.\n\n3: The game at the moment provide an average challenge and there is some reasonable character development.\n\n\nThe bad bits:\n1: The game is fun, but very repetitive. There does not seem to be a right or wrong way to play the game and as such if you bypass some of the set missions, all you seem to do is go from A to B, raid a building, and then develop the establishment. And that's it. That's \u00a341.99 right there.\n\n2: There are annoying quirks in the game that really serve no purpose, like when gangsters in your team fall out over who they fall in love with. Its a distraction that's not required, but I can probably get into it more if the Devs developed it a bit better such as being able to create multiple teams and you have to choose carefully who to put in that group.\n\n3: I have yet to come across any game killing bugs but I have found some annoying mechanics that need to be fixed, such as anomolies of enemy henchmen stuck in walls, or were their movement matrix fails so they can't exit a room. With the first issue I left the area and re-entered, the problem seemed to fix itself. The second issue fixed itself but I had to wait a few mins, I went to make myself a brew, when I came back it was fixed.\n\nAlthough I have ticked yes to recommending the game, in its current state, its not good value for money.

Voice acting can be abit cheesy and not really immersive but it kind of fits this 1920s noir, mafia narrative and gives it the comedic touch Which isnt all bad.\n\nI see they wanted to create this big open roaming area with the districts, but you end up just moving with taxi and right clicking to speed trough areas, cause lets be honest the world doesnt have much to offer, maybe in the beginning to create capital when i found out i can grab a few boxes in the alleys and then use that money to get 1-2 gansters and just start taking over rackets.\n\nThe combat isnt all bad its one of the more enjoyable points a big reason i bought the game for sure, but it is buggy at times and i feel like it needs work, specifically balancing and tweaking difficulty, i do not want to be able to enter lets say al capones stronghold no matter how poorly upgraded it is and just blow his head off with just my boss and an associate, i would like either a debuff being added to me making it harder or something along the lines of preventing movement from my district early on or also just providing some type of tweaking to were i cant go from 1-2 rackets and one ganster and then in less then 2-3 battles i own the entire city of chigago.\n\nSo after playing for about 3-4 hours on normal difficulty i decided to bump it up,  the hardest one, and im sorry but today i had a playtrough of about 3-4 hours of actual gameplay and that was doing side missions exploring and then I just decided to see how fast i could actually speedrun it and i would say i could probably get a victory in a new game in less then an hour with the right set up.\nThis feels extremely badly balanced, AI does extremely dumb things and sometimes it just has a flash of genius, the difficulty differences doesnt show. Also the police never once bothered me so i dont even know why they are in the game.\n\nThe economy system is invalidated by the ease of just being able to conquer bosses territory by just speedrunning into a safehouse, why not actually gating it, making it heavily protected if surrounded by rackets or something. \nThe management aspect I never once really touched, no diplomacy either (expect once and its also broken, being able to sell alcohol for ridiculous sums of cash cause they fear you) I get this but the problem is when i can just speedrun combat with the safehouses and then own all the other bosses districts there is no incentive to upgrade my own rackets or use diplomacy early, you can just grab a few empires and then sell theyre stash to other for huge amounts of cash, and then you never have to worry about money. So by never really touched means i gave it a look and realised it doesnt give anything and is just there to look like it adds something right now.\n\n\nI feel like this game tried so hard to do too many things and it shows, i enjoyed the atmosphere, the sound and music, I just think its to much that doesnt work.\n\nPros: nice graphical design, nice atmosphere, bit of comedy effect on the sound and voice acting but it adds to the feel.\n         Fun combat altough buggy and weird at times also too easy.\n         interesting concept with alot of good ideas.\n\nCons: Poorly executed ideas, merging too many things and it spoils the big whole. example: management and strategy in placement and rpg with quests and diplomacy and then going over to free roaming and turn based combat.\nIt feels like im playing 3-4 games merged together and sadly it spoils alot of good ideas.\n          \nNo difference so far in gangsters love interests or allies wich takes away potential replayability.\n\nBuggy and unbalanced combat, to easy alot of abilities are overly powerful, like grenades and long range weapons, not to talk about boss abilities, AI is terrible and does not give a challenge more or less giving you easy wins.\n\nmanagement and diplomacy doesnt really add anything or play a big part, you can just speedrun combat with safehouses and win.\n\nEnding statement:\n\nThis is hard cause i actually enjoy this game, I could easily boot it up for 1-2 hours and speedrun a few districts and challenge myself and see how early i can win, but that isnt what the game was designed to be, the game is sold with the image of giving you deep management and having to stay ontop of police and also dealing with other mafia bosses and empires trying to stay alive in chicagos underworld, and if thats the goal then its failed, this is a turn based (x-com) skinned with mafia characters set in a 1920 prohibition chicago scenario game, thats how ive played it, just gone from combat over and over again, cause nothing else really matters to win or progress.\n\nSo with that said I do not recommend this game at this time, who knows they might change alot and i might review this again, but at this time I do not support them charging 40 euros and i do not support the description of the game.\n\nI just hope the developers see the potential here, cause I still see it, they just aimed to high with this and they needed more testing done from players who gives actual feedback cause its obvious alot needs to be worked on.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1607284724, "timestamp_updated": 1607284724, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81744618": {"recommendationid": "81744618", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979038849", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1040, "last_played": 1606936411}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me start by saying the game is well made. \nThe reason for the down vote is due to 2 glaring issues I found.\n1> the AI is abysmal, there is no other way to put it and it needs no further clarification.\n2> the game is far to easy and doesn't scale well, I spent a fair half of my game playing with only my boss and one henchman and I was taking over blocks with minimal issue, then I started affording more gang and it was a washout especially when all you have to do is target the boss in their safehouse and take their entire empire over when you beat them, I was making 50k a week and toying with the last boss left just to unlock some more stuff. \n\nTLDR: the micromanagement of your empire is all well and good but it does very little in the scheme of things, its just way to easy to just go kill a mob boss and take over all their holdings.", "timestamp_created": 1607284483, "timestamp_updated": 1607284483, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81744604": {"recommendationid": "81744604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026357461", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1361, "last_played": 1607282774}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed the game.

One of the biggest concerns was the bad design of combat and the fact that you can't explore the city like Empire of Sin. You might ask why I am starting my review with this, and the answer is that people like me that use to play Gangsters Organized Crime back in the day have been waiting for a solid game that can bring that amazing concept once again. On that note, let's start with what I think so far about the game and why I would recommend it. First and foremost, even with some people saying that is null and gets repetitive the game is still fun. The diplomacy might not be relevant but you do enjoy the sit-downs were you can actually negotiate booze, war with factions, and much more. Now the con on this part is that the conversations are too repetitive and the animation sometimes feels not real. For example, Capone always raises his hand the same way for all threatening responses and that feels really simplistic. I do hope this gets fixed. Again diplomacy at this point might not be very efficient, but I do believe it makes the gaming experience more meaningful. Please Devs, if you are reading this, work more on this and add more victory conditions. At this point, the only one you can have is by killing all the gangs and there is no fun in having alliances because they are meaningless. You have rackets, but there is no front for them. How are you going to have an illegal business without any legal business at all? There should be interactions with more NPCs like city officials, judges, witness and such that would add more immersion to the game. The game does feel like a strategy game but sometimes is too cartoonish. For example, some gangsters really don't make sense and this I know can be done better. Also, please add: banks that we can rob and make business in, hotels with more meaningful management, and more rackets. The combat in this game is good but sometimes is dumb. For example, the AI does need some work but for the major part is solid. One issue that combat has is that when you have a lot of guards and gangsters in a small speakeasy, it is very hard to tell who is who because the colors are not very helpful and all the guards look the same. It would be nice if the game could add some type of drive-by feature to kill the guards in front of a building, which would add more to the immersion of the game. Finally, and I don't want to sound that I'm complaining too much, but the game can add the stuff I mention and deliver a true 1920 gangster experience that will make fans of the genre like myself happy. On the bug notes so far I haven't had any issues on my PC, no issues with corrupt save game files, and crashes so on that part I can't say anything bad about it.\n\nso I must say at this point 6/10. It is a fun first version of the game but It could be way better. It is a bit pricey, so f you are looking to save money, wait for more work to be done on it and then go for it. But do I recommend this game? Yes, it is a solid concept that just needs some work. Hope this review gets to someone in Romero Games. \n\nThanks for getting this far on this review btw.

One of it\u2019s most interesting features is the voiced cutscenes for diplomacy between factions; a unique and highly atmospheric feature that works well. Unfortunately, the rest of the game is a buggy mess. \n\nFrom the physics, to the quest scripts, to the combat effect interactions, every part of this game is buggy. In the 25 hours I have played this game, at least 20 quest locking or game freezing bugs occur, requiring either a reload or to give up on said quest, including the main story quest. The AI considers ransacking a racket the same as taking them over and will demand the racket back despite still owning the racket. A quest will require visiting locations that can be destroyed by the AI (or yourself) at any point thus locking out the quest.\n\nDespite these issues, I am still enjoying Empire of Sin but it is a bittersweet enjoyment.

In this game i have asian females/white females as everyone. In my opinion that completly destroys any roleplay factor and atmosphere. I don't think that this will be fixed at any point, because it seems there is some political agenda behind it. \n\nThe Rush feature is incredibly boring. I can buy an upgrade for a building and instantly rush it for some extra cash. Rome wasn't build in a single day, but sadly Chicago was. U get a lot of cash for some few quests and than u literally just finish all the economy part of the game within an hour. It's incredibly boring. \n\nSome of these Mafia Bosses are incredibly broken and losing and winning rackets is incredibly underwhelming and boring aswell. I was cocky and started a war i should have lost. I had to defend 6 rackets in a row with the same 3 guards. No auto resolve function i had to fight these fights manually and it was boring as hell. Afterwards i moved to the enemy safehouse and my boss won the whole war alone by himself. Losing and Winning neither one of them was fun.

I've only played as Al Capone to start off with and get a feel for basic game mechanics, but am interested in additional play through as the other available syndicate bosses.  While there are a noticeable amount of bugs and glitches, the autosave feature as well as ability to manually save help mitigate any significant setbacks should you need to exit the game and reload.  Alot of the negative reviews don't have any notable feedback of worth, primarily just kids crying about how their toaster PCs can't handle the game, or otherwise just being sad salty children without any impactful feedback for what they feel makes the game \"bad\".\n\nThe tutorial seems lacking and the business management aspects of the game seem to be not fully fleshed out.  The combat mechanics are simple and pretty much the standard you would expect for tactical combat based fight system.  \n\nThe city map seems unpolished and rushed to have been dumped out with simple geometric graphics which is a real shame.  The standard view when wandering the city is nice to look at and runs smoothly at 120 FPS in 4k resolution.\n\nThe game seems to be mainly story focused more so than on the difficulty of combat or the city builder/ management features.  I'm interested to see what future updates bring, hopefully some touch ups on different graphic elements, some more quality of life improvements like equipment comparison tooltips, and potentially more mob boss selection.\n\nFor the $40 price tag, and the future promise of additional campaign content, I'd recommend the game.  Once it has been released for a while and inevitably goes onto sale in one of the countless Steam sales that occur every other month, a discounted purchase would definitely be worth the investment if you enjoy tactical combat games, historically inaccurate but clearly inspired prohibition era games, and a little bit of business management/ lemonade stand type games all mixed into one neat package, then this game would be a winner for you.\n\n7/10 enjoyable game with an interesting enough story to keep my attention.  Graphics are nice but not the most beautiful thing to come out lately.  Recommended machine specs are not all that demanding, and so anyone giving negative reviews for poor performance must be playing on a early 2k macbook or other overpriced paperweight.", "timestamp_created": 1607231750, "timestamp_updated": 1607231750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81703556": {"recommendationid": "81703556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092985913", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "playtime_at_review": 1963, "last_played": 1618156513}, "language": "english", "review": "I really do enjoy playing this game. There's interesting character stories, and a really fun and interesting system for your hired guns, but there really needs to be a lot more patching to be done, and honestly, it shouldn't have been released as it is currently. Weird bugs I've had show up thus far:\n\n1. Double the combat buttons for every character. All fully functional. \n\n2. Quest markers not appearing.\n\n3. A quest not clearing properly after character conversation. Attempting to repeat the conversation creates an infinite list of the next task without the quest marker moving.\n\n4. When the AI declares war, getting SPAMMED with fights (I mean like 4 separate fight prompts in 1 seconds.) Even if you say yes to every fight, it will only let you fight one,  the ones you didn't fight counts it as a loss  and you will be spammed so much with prompts that you just lose. (Not the game, just that war)\n\n5. After killing the one and only combatant, the fight not ending unless you flee the fight, counting as a loss.\n\n6. Both AI & myself being able to frequently shoot through full cover walls.\n\n7. People stuck in pose after combat. (Seems to have been recently fixed)\n\n8. Guards who were sitting at the beginning of combat in a speakeasy remaining sitting while fighting.  Even as they glide to a new position. (Not fixed)\n\n9. Killing a thug so hard he comes back up only to die again, but more dramatically.\n\n10. Being able to click combat buttons that are meant to be unselectable. Most common with Overwatch ability.\n\nThere's probably some I've forgotten at this point because it is so buggy. I really want to love this game, I have a lot of fun playing it at times, but some of these bugs can make the game frustrating and unplayable. \n\nIf you're interested in this game, I strongly suggest waiting at least a month post release so they can get it patched and for a sale.

I was able to figure out so many major exploits through so many things that kept the AI opponents from ever squaring up with me on the management level. \n\nFor example. You perform fights with thugs, they drop items used to equip your team but you can sell those greens to other mob bosses. You know how much money the bosses have.  The greens are worth SO much money, selling one is like 3 upgrades to your illegal businesses. You get so many of these greens so often and other mob bosses NEVER refuse a good deal and even give you reputation when you do this, so you just sell them until the other mob bosses have no money and you keep them deadlocked. Given mob bosses good deals continues to improve reputation to like so sort of bug? but eventually you can ask them for all their money AND one of their green guns FOR ONE OF THE EXACT GUNS YOU OWN. So you can just start consuming every bosses money. You grow, they can't.\n\nPlus the right the way you're supposed to probably play the game is... go to war with enemy mob boss and slowly take over their businesses one by one and infiltrate their turf. But nothing stops you from just parking outside their safe house... going to war with them... and storming the safe house, killing them, and taking over their entire operation. \n\nThe combat system/engine was very good though, it's solid, getting purps for my mobsters and leveling them up and getting new skills, and the mob boss battles we're fun and strategic.

Here is just a few of the worse ones; \n-Some missions do not resolve properly, you get the rewards, but the missions do not clear away. Eventually the bad consequences of missions with limited time will happen as well when missions fail to complete properly. \n- Gang members, or the entire gang, including your boss, can disappear if you are inside a building while upgrading it and rushing the upgrades. I found this particularly true of breweries. The only character you can get back without loading is your boss character, by \"travelling to\", the other gang members are in limbo. \n- Enemy gangs can acquire characters without having raised their Notoriety Points sufficiently. All recruitable characters have a minimum demand for how Notorious you are. However the computer can recruit characters ignoring this, meaning the entire point of raising your Notoriety faster than everybody else is gone. The AI cheats in crew recruitment. \n- Once a Cooperation Deal was cancelled by a rival gang the dialog box refused to close. When this happened for me that last quick save was also corrupted. Progress was lost. \n\nBasically; the game has game breaking bugs.\n\nI rate games on a die of 1-6, but with 0 for absolute failures. Minimum for recommended is 3. \n\nThis is a 2.

The common refrain seems to be it's just buggy and while it's certainly incredibly buggy that's not the extend of the game's issues.\n\nOn the topic of bugs, in the fourteen or so hours I've played I've had multiple Quest triggers fail, animations routinely fail to load (with a handful of game ending freezes) and a dead man requesting we end our War.  I'm running the game on all of the preset settings.  This is literally the first run any playtester should have ran.  Take a glance at the official bug forums ( httpsforum.paradoxplaza.comforumforumsempire-of-sin-bug-reports.1086 ) and just read the thread titles as it's is a comedy goldmine.\n\nNow to the meat of the game; There are two major modes of gameplay.  The first and the one you'll be spending most of your time in is the combat.  There's UI issues abound and for the sake of brevity here's a quick list;\n\nFiring a Primary weapon ends your turn, firing a Secondary does not.  To swap to a Secondary requires you to, well, click the swap command and confirm.  Simple enough, yeah  There are literally two options for your secondary Fire and Reload (a Secondary Shotgun will have a Cone AoE option as well).  An average turn when you don't have to move is  SWAP Weapon  FIRE Weapon  SWAP Weapon  FIRE Weapon.  Just add the two options to the basic bar!  Fire (Primary) and Fire (Secondary) along with Reload (Primary) and (Secondary).\n\nThe UI will list multiple instances of the same options - My Maria has three end turns.  They all do the same thing.  This is likely a bug, but it's pretty easy to figure out why it happens.  One of her Perks is to take a move after an attack.  This added it's own End Turn option.  As did another ability.\n\nNow we're actually playin', baby!  Well great, here's the thing about Weapon Balance.  There isn't any.  In a comical flaw, Burst Weapons roll to hit for each bullet.  This means that anyone that can wield a [Sub]Machine Gun should target the hardest to hit enemies.  45% to Hit  I'll take those odds on my five rounds every turn.  Oh, while we're here attacks are only modeled against the characters selected.  So if you hit and kill an enemy with your first bullet in a Burst fire the guy directly behind will not take any damage at all.  If you miss a guy in the middle of a crowd you will *never* hit anything.  Jagged Alliance and X Com had this in the early/Mid Nineties.\n\nEnemy AI is dreadful.  They charge.  Everyone.  Every time. Seriously.  This was supposed to be brief.  Jesus.\n\nThe Available Gang members page is static game to game.  Getting the higher tier Gangsters means playing with the lower ones.  Every single game.  But don't fret!  The bonuses you get for using Characters means that you'll likely want extra bullets in your Burst fire conga line over a slight boost in higher stats anyways.\n\nThe Second part of the tactical portion of the game is moving and controlling or defending the streets.  This is made laughable by a couple of systems.  Chiefly that your crew can instantly teleport to any location you have revealed on the map by right clicking on a building and selecting Travel Here.  The game gives you a notice of where the enemy is planning to attack so you can teleport to a location, massacre the assailant and repeat, with virtually zero time taken off the in game clock.\n\nNow you're given a map and on that map are various buildings, and most of them allow for you or rival gangs to control them as Rackets which feeds into the Economic side of the game (oh we'll get there).  You may attack and take over enemy turf.  Of which there is one map of each type per size of location.  The first, second and twentieth assault on a Mid Size Speakeasy will be the same location.  Any every time in between.\n\nThankfully, there's a helpful catch pre programmed into the game for you. Successfully attacking an enemy Safehouse knocks that Rival out of the game... and grants you their entire empire.  There is no reason to ever attack an enemy Racket.  If you need quick cash, take out an identical derelict building or three.  It's way easier and it's way more beneficial for you to just declare War and take everything all at once against a Rival by teleporting directly to their front door and waging the shortest War ever.\n\nThe game tries to discourage your time and space bending gang by having you not heal between battles.  But there's no different damage states.  So if you heal in mid battle you'll come out flawlessly.\n\n...Which leads to pushing the Control key to instigate a sneak attack in your area, and in this case on nothing and then pressing Tab until you get your doctor and using their skill to heal.  And ending combat, clearing their cooldown, and doing it again.  Near instantaneously. \n\nOn to the Economics!\n\nWant infinity money  Sell garbage alcohol to the smaller, Minor Gangs disguised as Whiskey.  For some reason, they have infinite money and will always accept your deal.\n\nWhich is better than engaging with the actual systems present.  Your income randomly rises and falls, based on Customers Winning Big at your Casinos.  But you never get a notification that your House just took a loss.  It seems like it tallies up all of this at the start of a week instead of being organic and shifting through the day.\n\nBecome a gun runner.  Sell everything you don't need. It's simply less miserable than trying to figure out how all your Rackets collide in it's huge mess.  It's almost indecipherable at the start of the game when you've got three buildings.  It's the spreadsheet from Hell by the time you're out of your starting Neighbourhood.\n\nDiplomacy!\n\nHahahahahahahaha oh dear God I'm done.", "timestamp_created": 1607209249, "timestamp_updated": 1607209263, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81688371": {"recommendationid": "81688371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040522603", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 375, "last_played": 1607156577}, "language": "english", "review": "This game makes me so sad...I really really wanted it to be good so bad...Its just not fun.

The writing and weird cast of characters, both fictional and fictionalized alike, have a lot of charm. There's even really delightfully over-the-top voice acting for nearly every character, littered with standout performances like gangster boss Frankie Donovan, aged Western sharpshooter Grover Monks, or the hammy duo performance of a gambling bookie and a button man. (They're in love.) The charm wore off a lot quicker than I\u2019d have liked, though.\nFights quickly become rote due to mindlessly repetitive maps and poor, buggy combat AI.\nThe challenge here is to run a complex illegal empire while also balancing the chaotic personalities of criminals both in your gang and outside it. Like many of Empire of Sin\u2019s ideas, it's a brilliant concept: You have to keep a lot of violent people with poor impulse control both happy and alive in turn-based tactical RPG combat in the vein of XCOM. You direct your chosen gang boss around the city, doing missions with bits of flavorful dialogue to enjoy and controlling a crew of hired guns in battles against other gangsters. Those might be fights with rival gangs, groups of independent thugs, and very occasionally even the police or the Bureau of Prohibition's agents. Interacting with the characters of the '20s is where Empire of Sin shines, but the fights you're doing to earn those stories quickly become rote due to mindlessly repetitive maps and poor, buggy combat AI.\n\nThe tactical battles are built on good bones: Gangsters have a to-hit stat, hit points, and you find weapons with varied stats. Basic combat numbers are pretty granular, with health in the 50-150 range, so a thug might take two to four pistol shots to go down. It's just enough randomness to make the weapon stats and upgraded rarities really matter. There's also a half-or-full-cover system you'll recognize from every tactics game since 2012, well implemented here, with angle of attack and distance mattering depending on what weapon you're using: a shotgun does best from within two tiles, a rifle from seven or more, and a submachine gun is happiest somewhere in the middle. There are balance issues, like one-hit kills from sniper rifles and surprise damage from unavoidable dynamite attacks, but there's fun at the tactical core.\n\nIt's the maps that really kill the combat. They're pretty, at least, thanks to locations like dim speakeasy interiors and luxurious gambling houses, but they\u2019re chokepointed, poorly laid out, and offer very little tactical variety. Most fights end up revolving around a single corner or doorway as you set up a kill zone and watch enemies swarm into it \u2013 and many of the maps only have one or two of those chokepoints to fight over. The terrain is static as well: there\u2019s no destruction, and no interesting ways for characters to get around. It's an honest crime that you can't vault over the bar counters into cover like in every gangster movie ever.\nThe dominance of some strategies over others undermines what should otherwise be a wide-open sandbox game.\nAll of that goes on as you build up your network of illegal breweries, casinos, speakeasies, and brothels to get rich on the management side. To do that you have to  stay out of the police force's sight and try to one-up rival bosses in both business and territory control. The way it\u2019s all executed, though, makes it little more than surface-level fun with no balance or depth: Alcohol out, money in, but you never make enough money to really feel like Scarface because upgrades and gang members are absurdly expensive. Of course, that rarely matters because the dominance of some strategies over others undermines what should otherwise be a wide-open sandbox game.\n\nYou can, in theory, play many ways, such as diplomatically catering to allies and placating opponents as you build up your empire, but those are never the best idea. Why would you wait for your cash reserves to build \u2013 and I mean literally wait, since the management layer is real-time and has a single speed \u2013 in order to wage a full-scale gang war when you can just directly attack enemies and take everything they have in one fight?\n\nPart of the issue with the strategy layer is that while the city is nice to look at, getting your characters to where you need them to be becomes a major chore. Your characters control in real time on the streets, and you order them around like units in an RTS until combat starts. They're slow to react, slow to move, and frustratingly bad at pathfinding, requiring constant hand-holding. This makes attacking enemies building-by-building frustrating and boring: You move from place to place and attack, fight the same three or four guards on the same three or four maps, then take over the building.\nWhile the city is nice to look at, getting your characters where they need to be becomes a major chore.\nWhile you\u2019re doing this, enemy crews are attacking your rackets, subjecting you to an endless stream of boring defensive matchups between your hopelessly outgunned guards and big swarms of enemies. You, meanwhile, can really only afford to field one effective combat team. I have no idea where the other side gets their large bands of roving, well-armed, disposable muscle, but you're limited to a few precious and expensive gangsters.\n\nFights might be more fun if you could afford more gangsters and more security upgrades for your rackets, but you really can't. The economics are so poorly balanced that amassing any large amount of cash is really only possible once you\u2019ve already built a huge empire of rackets, and even then you burn through it buying just a handful of incremental upgrades. Think spending $3,000 dollars for\u2026 +7% on a building's income of $500. Woohoo, only 85 in-game weeks before I break even! That's just a mere... hour and a half of my life. (One game speed, remember?)\n\nThe interface, by the way, is truly terrible for managing a huge empire. You can own dozens of businesses but there's no single screen to manage them all at once. Instead, you get to sort through them neighborhood-by-neighborhood on screens that also have all your competitors' businesses. To upgrade them, you must open a new screen for each business, one at a time. I eventually resorted to simply building new businesses, ignoring all upgrades, and hoping that quantity had a quality all its own. Thankfully, that worked.\nJust drive over to the other boss' house and shoot them in the face.\nSo how do you win a gang war, then? How do you get rich? Simple: You just drive over to the other boss' house and shoot them in the face. See, your units can teleport around the city by \"driving\" instantly to any discovered place. So you just declare war, teleport to the front door of the enemy's safehouse, and assault it, bypassing any defense their armies of soldiers would have provided. Defeating the enemy boss in their HQ means you instantly take over all their buildings: Congratulations, your empire has now doubled in size and you got a really overpowered bit of unique gear to boot.\n\nIt's a shame, because the glimmers of a great game are here. Take your crew: The network of thugs-for-hire in your black book all have morale and loyalty scores, their own specific background traits, personalities, and relationships to the other gangsters. They get mad or worried when their lover is injured, and they won't shoot a friend on the other side of a fight. They can gain new relationships in play, become alcoholics, or get syphilis. Gangsters can die permanently, too, which is fun to avoid once someone becomes integral to your crew. Push them far enough and they'll leave your gang. But even with all of that promise, Empire of Sin\u2019s many faults have pushed me too far.\n", "timestamp_created": 1607206858, "timestamp_updated": 1607206858, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81686852": {"recommendationid": "81686852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023253219", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1432, "last_played": 1615755285}, "language": "english", "review": "After 30 min of play all is same ... boring", "timestamp_created": 1607206440, "timestamp_updated": 1607206440, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81684815": {"recommendationid": "81684815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880857906", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1178, "last_played": 1615163598}, "language": "english", "review": "Is the game unbearably glitchy at the moment?

The game look tacky and EXTREMELY OUT OF THE GANGSTER VIBE. \nThere is no campaign, only a sandbox mode filled with missions that do no more than guide you through the plot of your main character, that could be interesting if not for the limited amount of options and outcomes you have, so there is no narrative. \nHalf of your guards are women, because gender equality apparently was a thing back then. Costumers in your rackets all look the same, if they are wearing coats they look like lab scientists, so you can picture your speakeasy full of lab coats and a couple of she-hulk guards. By the way, making a character's style badass and punkish doesn't make it look like a gangster.\n\n- Graphics & Sound \nSome characters were well made, the models are fine, there is a certain level of attention to detail but nothing special, the animations in the other hand are a lackluster specially in dialogues where it contributes to the taky vibe. The battles are very uninteresting visually speaking, the blood looks gooey, the scenarios are limited and the animation makes the characters lifeless, its just a bunch of human bodies moving around.\nThe voice acting I'd consider fair, nothing special here either. \nThe soundtrack is decent if not relaxing. \nI'm not a demanding person when it comes to graphic or sound quality so this doesn't bother me.\n\n- The UI & Gameplay\nReally bad. If you want to change an equipment you better remember the stats of the current equipment so you can compare to the new equipment.\nThe information panels does a poor job at demonstrating information, you need to dig in to find what you are looking for, you could see a lot more with much less.\nIt's unfortunate that for every attack you have to directly control the battle, a simulation (total war style) would be a nice quality of life. \nMany bugs.\nThere is a limited amount of options in dialogue, more so in outcomes, rendering a narrow window of opportunities, so there is not much to engage in here. \nThe good thing is the keybindings, you can pretty much play this game almost entirely without using a mouse. if in battle hovering the mouse to a space will show the % of accuracy for hitting targets, that's neat. \n\nFinal Words\nThis game is a bit childish in some senses, from the design of the characters to the playability. A try-hard attempt, there is nothing to make you feel like in the 1920's. I don't know how to express it better, THERE IS NO GANGSTER VIBE, that's it.

That didn't last very long, and to give the game some story they placed some small side story which is a side quest you do not need to do, but that part is actually the best part of the game. Kinda sad that the part they didn't spend voice actors on is the best.\n\nGameplay:\nI like that the more you use a weapon the better the person gets with that weapon, unfortunately only kills makes you better, so melee takes a while since most weapons take 2 - 3 hits for a kill and by then, your main char has already killed EVERYBODY!\n\nOther people have said it. It plays like XCOM and XCOM 2 but with a braindead AI. Usually, I give my main and the supporting characters Sniper rifles, since they can one-shot kill most mops and with some skills, you can even kill a boss with one character. This is nice if you want to win, but get's super boring real quick.\n\nTook me a while to figure out that when you attack a boss, where one of our henchmen got a friend or lover hired by your rival, you can \"save\" them by killing your rival, and hope they panic and leave the battlefield. I've tried once or twice that they changed their mind when they were almost out, so had to kill them... my henchmen didn't leave me, so not a big loss.\n\nMajor bugs:\nAttention! Major Bugs is in this game, and you MUST salute him!\nMost of the bugs I've run into are:\n- Battle loading and a month prompt plays at the same time, stalling the game creating the need to Ctrl+F4 the game.\n- You entering a building to start a fight and another building gets attacked that you HAVE to control to protect, only to get stuck in one of the buildings with no way of exiting the building (Ctrl+F4)\n- Playing for so long that the interface of your buildings breaks, making it impossible to manage your buildings unless you find each of the buildings, enter the building, manage it. Repeat.\n- When using the sniper rifle with Mapel from the Ally Cats, she got her rifle skills leveled up when using her master skill instead of the sniper rifle. Don't know if that's because she'll always use a rifle with that skill, but this game blows at giving your information about anything.\n- I have NO idea if the Mole role actually does anything! I had one guy as a mole for almost a year, and I killed the boss he was a mole at before he actually did anything of value, so just hire a nobody and use them as a mole, if you want their quest completed.\n- and many many more bugs ...\n\nFinal thoughts:\nIt had a good idea, but the game is slow and when I finally ended the game with one character, it felt like I just wasted all of my time, since it just gives a bland conversation like what you begin with, and then it just says, \"You Win\" but you feel like it's saying, \"Thanks for the money, we won\"", "timestamp_created": 1607199548, "timestamp_updated": 1607803223, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81680730": {"recommendationid": "81680730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154940320", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 135, "playtime_at_review": 954, "last_played": 1618868079}, "language": "english", "review": "the game is alot of fun but what make me quit plying it for some time is can the shooting throw walls be fix?", "timestamp_created": 1607199180, "timestamp_updated": 1607199180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81680189": {"recommendationid": "81680189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006663427", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 423, "last_played": 1607204653}, "language": "english", "review": "I think the main take away from the game is that depending how you feel it is either not sure what it wants to be or it was a gamble that did not entirely pay off.\n\nThe main systems that I view in this are X-Com (Remake) combat, Gangsters (late 90's game) concept, along with some very light business management, and quest and RPG elements.  On it's surface, those are all very good ideas and if they're put together, I would absolutely adore this game because it's what I want.  However, it suffers from 'just missed the mark' on every one of the things it sought to bring to the table and it leaves one wanting.\n\nX-Com style combat?  Unpolished and inconsistent with damage, character ability, mechanic function, item availability and trait development.  I'm not sure how the X-Com turn based firefight which has turned into the new standard could be so glitchy and difficult to implement for the studio.\n\nLight business management?  It's not as deep as the number of screens likes to make it seem.  It lacks any refinement and the depth of interaction that the Gangsters Game had with it's industries and businesses.  All money is the same, any structure is the same, the five illicit businesses are the same no matter where they are.  You can stick five casinos next to each other and they function the same with the same income, ditto with brothels, or speakeasies.  Fifteen illegal bars on the same block have zero impact on how much they earn.  Changes are incremental at best, and have no real effect.  There's no real techniques to hide anything other than investing in 'deflections' nothing as refined as Gangsters of hiding brothels in legit hotels, or speakeasies inside of resturants...just click the box and you're good.\n\nQuest and RPG Elements.  The game wants you to think that you're an RPG, that you have dialogue choices with other gangsters, make deals, have an effect on them.  Wants you to think that they might actually act differently depending on how much they like you and your behavior towards them affects the relationship you have.  Nope, someone can be polite and professional in a meeting, or act really friendly, and have MASSIVE debuffs towards you that makes war inevitable.  Your character can only click on tribute and hope that will help.\n\nThe game wants to be far more than it is, far, far more than it is.  And while it's not a horrible game, it just does not really nail anything so well that you overlook the exceptionally mediocre other aspects of the game that miss their mark.  \n\nIt might be worth getting if you haven't played the other games that this one is borrowing from, but if you're here, you already have.  It will get better when there's a modding community, and probably after the standard Paradox DLC business plan kicks in, until then, give it a pass.", "timestamp_created": 1607198536, "timestamp_updated": 1607198536, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664014279842376709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81678833": {"recommendationid": "81678833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239193490", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 209, "last_played": 1612494827}, "language": "english", "review": "I dont see the problems other people are having. its an enjoyable game.", "timestamp_created": 1607196974, "timestamp_updated": 1607196991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81678583": {"recommendationid": "81678583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077855886", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 178, "last_played": 1607208551}, "language": "english", "review": "This game pisses me off.

Managing buildings is very important since you need to upgrade them for security, increase income, etc. Very time consuming and thought provoking mechanics.\n\nCombat threw me off in the beginning since how can a shotgun miss point blank to the head, but realized this isnt real life and a game so the hit % are different. Combat gets repetitive and hopefully there will be an auto fight function put in, especially when another fraction attacks your buildings and you are not there. There are only 2 options- fight or abandon. Combat is quite fun, planning on where to take cover and getting to the best spot to get a good shot off. \n\nThere are some glitches and bugs that needs to addressed and hopefully soon, which I believe it will be since a major patch came out day(s) after release. No company ever releases a perfect game on day 1 and with the progress that Romero is making within the first week of release, I believe this game will only get better and better as the updates and new content get released. \n\nOverall, I am loving the game and recommend getting the game if you enjoy this genre.", "timestamp_created": 1607194797, "timestamp_updated": 1607194797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81676459": {"recommendationid": "81676459", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983022067", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1046, "last_played": 1607464531}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh boy...this is very beta.

Got'em. Try and navigate a crew of more than 4 through the map and they will get stuck unless you keep clicking just in front of them. \n\nAnimation glitches? All the time. It's really common to see characters frozen into a single pose, gliding around from place to place. \n\nBroken faction system? Check. You are constantly spammed with pointless requests from other factions, things like protect me for 6 months for a couple hundred dollars. Refuse and you lose support, but even if you don't refuse, the NPC faction may cancel and then immediatly ask for the same request. I would receive the same request from an NPC faction 4-5 times, as fast as I could click on the no button. \n\nBroken economy? Yup. It's well known that you can buy Swill for a couple of bucks and sell it to the computer generated factions (generic factions without a \"Boss\" like the AI factions do) 'disguised' as whiskey for a fortune. \n\nBroken quests? Right here! Lots of seriously broken quests, but a famous one is when the Undertaker won't recognize a body when presented with one. Lot's more to choose from though. \n\nBroken game mechanics? the one that jumps out here is how you take over rival AI factions. For the computer generated, 'Minor' factions you have to take over all their rackets. But to take out a 'Major' faction like Al Capone, all you need to do is take over their Safe House, and you suddenly have taken over their whole 'empire'. This is so easy that once you have a decent crew, eliminating all of the other Major factions is trivial... Much harder than dealing with the Minor ones. \n\nOf course the game is so buggy that sometimes a faction you destroyed will still pop up in some of the management screens... Sigh. \n\nGame-Breaking bugs? Yup, quire a few of these. The one I ran into is when your crew is inside a building as it's being upgraded. This can make them all disappear. For regular gangsters you can fore them, then rehire them if you have enough cash. \n\nFor me though, my Boss also was spirited away into another dimension, meaning every mission that required the Boss to do or say something was now impossible to complete. \n\nPointless plot? I'd say so. I love single-player games because rather than worrying about how to handle multiplayer junk like comms and server loading, devs can focus on story and content. That seems to have been left out here though. The few quests I was able to complete were pretty generic, and hardly grabbed my attention. \n\nMaybe if the rest of the game wasn't such a hot mess I could focus on the story and get more out of it, but as it stands it's not up to snuff. \n\nThe simple truth is this game probably needs another 6 months to a year of work. I would absolutly NOT purchase it in the next few months. This is not something that a few patches will fix. My guess is at least three major patches will be required to get this game even playable. \n\nLook at the reviews again next Spring and see if they have improved. But for now, don't spend your money. This will be the first time I'll have ever asked Steam for a refund on a game, but I have to on this one. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1607193625, "timestamp_updated": 1607193625, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.799455642700195313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81675703": {"recommendationid": "81675703", "author": {"steamid": "76561199025197021", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 318, "last_played": 1607489331}, "language": "english", "review": "I am mixed on the game.

Sadly, it falls short, but not so short that I think it cannot be addressed by patches.\n\nFirst, I want to say I'm thrilled that this game exists. The subject matter, the setting, and the game systems are all aspects I tend to gravitate towards. There aren't many games that scratch this itch for me. This is why I hope the devs continue to look at the feedback, digest it, and work towards a more polished, bug-free experience. I don't want to see DLC released until the core gameplay is solid. Do that and you're dead to me.\n\nWhat I like most:\n -> The turn-based XCOM combat system combined with a large assortment of gangsters to hire who all exhibit varying traits (and can gain new traits). It has issues and I get into that later, but this system was a good choice for this game.\n\n ->  There are decisions that impact your experience, sometimes right down to you losing hired gangsters because of conflicts/failed missions. Decisions, or lack of, being impactful is good (imho).\n\n -> The UI is pretty good. The character sheets look good, and all of the panels are setup nicely so one can find the info they need. I don't think there is any info that is nested deep down in any panel. Everything feels fast and snappy on my end, right down to the load times.\n\n -> The equipment seems to matter, and the loot system appears just right for this kind of game. Gangster traits are very nice and give you some nice decisions to make.\n\n -> The overhead map system is pretty slick and makes navigation fairly easy. It could use some refinement when using the mouse wheel to zoom out, but the M key works best to immediately get to the overhead mode.\n\n -> I like that rackets aren't just carbon copies of each other. They have pros/cons, different costs, etc. I just wish there were more types of rackets that I could pick from.\n\nThings that need help and distract from the experience:\n -> Combat animations are not polished (blips, poor transitions between states).\n\n -> In a few instances I've lost rackets without any notice. They're just gone. I wasn't given an opportunity to protect or reclaim the racket. This feels like a major bug to me and it needs to be addressed. Sinking a lot of cash into a racket for it to vanish without an opportunity to save it is poor design if this isn't a bug.\n\n -> When combat is initiated, your gangsters can be situated next to thugs. This isn't very practical or good for giving the player more agency. When this happens, it means cover is meaningless and your gang could start with a large disadvantage. In XCOM, and other games, the maps are large enough so the player can set the table as necessary - to better prep for the combat to come. Even though the maps are small, this can be fixed if thugs and gangsters don't commingle at the start - specifically for non-story combat missions. Another way to solve this is to have a setup phase happen before combat, allowing the player to position their gangsters within a defined area of the map.\n\n -> Income/Upkeep doesn't feel balanced. I'm always short on cash. When one of my rackets mysteriously vanishes, yeah, that really sucks for my wallet. I can't purchase items, hire new gangsters, without the worry of how I will pay for something if another racket goes belly-up.\n\n -> I've had missions fail for no reason. If there are missions that are timed, or have conditions, these have to be more transparent to the player.\n\n -> Many of the combat maps are too small and uninteresting. I'd like to see something other than a derelict building populated with thugs. Maybe it gets more interesting later on? Either way, I want to see maps that are cosmetically different, perhaps even with destructible items/cover.\n\n -> Some of the gangster skills seem overpowered.\n\n -> The AI is downright horrible. They make horrible decisions and cheapen the combat experience. Sometimes the AI is fixated on one gangster. Sometimes the AI circles around the map. Sometimes they move next to a gangster but shoot at someone else further away. It's total chaos sometimes. You could place your gangsters behind cover and use overwatch to dispatch most of the AI (albeit making a boring combat session).\n\n -> Melee seems hugely under-powered unless I'm missing something. If a thug rolls towards me with hopes of using his fists, he's never going to make it unless I roll poorly in my shots or there are multiple thugs trying to melee me. Perhaps gangsters should have massive penalties to long guns if a thug is in melee range? Or perhaps make some melee thugs that are heavily armored?  I think all of this needs to be changed, right down to how many choke points are on map and/or reducing the arc of overwatch.\n\nIf you read this far I give you crazy mad gold stars.\n", "timestamp_created": 1607192681, "timestamp_updated": 1607192681, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545743286609649658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81674578": {"recommendationid": "81674578", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972579966", "num_games_owned": 706, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 159, "last_played": 1606874554}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommend you steer clear.

Most annoying bugs were resolved in the first few days and the game runs just fine now. Its XCOM-style turn-based combat, fighting for control of illegal businesses, getting into wars with other factions, and ultimately trying to come out on top. \n\nYou run a crew of 'real' gangsters, up to ten, and from 5 'classes', which can be further customized with a tree of talents to choose from, and further with their gear, weapons, etc. You manage various seedy businesses, but there's not much depth there. Missions drive some storylines, but aside from the first few that give you alot of cash to initially get started in the gameworld, they don't do much. The real fun is in taking over existing businesses from other factions, and growing your own empire. Hired Gangsters are powerful, and expensive, so your main goal is to have enough businesses to support both hiring, keeping, and outfitting your gangsters, so that you can stand up to the other major factions.\n\nAtmosphere is high quality, theres fun diversity in gangsters including their dress and special abilities, and the combat is challenging at higher difficulties. I'd play on the standard starting difficulty if you're not familiar with XCOM style games, and a higher difficulty if you are.

Empire of Sin is a very simplified Gangster style XCOM, set in the 1920s during the Prohibition Era: Your goal? Conquer Chicago.  If a combat heavy (not even joking about this part) game of such style is of interest to you, then yes, I do recommend it.\n\nIf you are however interested in a management focused game, or perhaps not having to fight (every) engagement all manual like, then I recommend sticking clear.  It's a game with a lot of potential, but I personally don't see going past more than one full run before moving onto something else.  Maybe only coming back once in a few months during a dry spell with other games.\n\nEach boss you can choose feels somewhat unique, even if their conquest of Chicago plays out largely the same.  While you certainly can spend time upgrading your empire's businesses, there will eventually be so many, and virtually no difference between them, you'll just want whatever increases profit enough to equip your gangsters for upcoming wars with your rivals.  Which can be short and brutal by essentially going straight for the leader, a departure from the methodical approaches of the old Hothouse Gangsters games of yore.\n\nOverall I'd say the game's relatively average, but definitely something you can sink hours into and have a degree of fun with.  Whether you'd have the endurance to take each boss onto the path of glory as Chicago's rising kingpin, well that's up to you.\n\nI myself, did get my money's worth, even despite various bugs showing up.

It basically needs the below to make it playable:\n\n- DIPLOMACY OVERHAUL -. I rate games like this straight away on how they handle diplomacy. The sit downs are a great idea but are terrible. They should have functioned like an interactive story book with many unique situations coming from them. Also, you shouldn't always have to come off as an arsehole when speaking to other factions.....that is what diplomacy is! (Cant see this being fixed due to the costs involved with getting voice actors back).\n\n- AI - The Ai is shockingly bad. Standard issue in games but can be fixed\n\n- COMPLETE PLAYER / AI INBALANCE - Games like this desperately need to feel fair and that both AI players and you are doing the same things to reach the ultimate goal of winning the game. For a start, the AI player just constantly throws generic gangsters when at war - something you cannot do except for when defending. Any unique gangsters the AI may have will always be waiting for you at their safe house. The Black List of gangster shouldn't even exist, it should be that the generic gangsters evolve into RANDOMLY generated gangsters that can be customised like X-com - a game this heavily takes from. Doubtful this will get fixed due to the sheer balancing issues this would cause.\n\n- HEISTS/ROBBERIES - Why oh why are they missing in this game? You should have had to start at the bottom and work your way up. Simply to fix.\n\n- AUTO RESOLVE - I do not understand how this game is missing an auto-resolve option? Something i have no doubt will be added in the very next patch. With the constant generic gangster spam being thrown at my buildings - this was the main reason i stopped playing. Utterly game breaking.\n\n- LACK OF PLAY TESTING - I played on the medium difficulty and had three times more points than any of the other 10 AI players. Seems you can just take over buildings constantly with 3/4 strong gangsters and make money that way. Use the money to buy other buildings and you will then take over whole neighbourhoods shortly.  Rinse and repeat then expect the inevitable spam attacks...which is when you turn the game off. if you manage to stay sane enough to continue playing....use the shallow booze system to make the booze you need and then where it should be distributed. I can just imagine raising the difficult wont improve AI....just add cheat modifiers to the battles and stupid percentage hit chance increases.

This is a fun game that feels like an upgrade to Omerta which is also on Steam. I will break the game down in to different aspects and give my opinions on each aspect: its strengths, shortcomings, and ways to improve.\n\nCombat - Combat is my favorite aspect of this game and is a very big part of the game. You will be spending most of the game in combat as you are taking over buildings from thugs or rival gangs as well as defending from attacks on your properties. Some abilities are not as good as others and a specific ability was way too overpowered during my playthrough after obtaining it. This ability allowed you to chain attacks as long as each attack kills an opponent. This seems difficult but once you obtain a very powerful machine gun then each attack will definitely kill any adversary. Pair this with your boss always getting first initiative you end up with running to the middle of the room and killing 8 targets and wounding the boss before anyone has a chance of attacking you. Once I discovered this ability was overpowered I was able to beat the game within an hour by simply attacking the boss safehouse and ignoring all other buildings.\n\nWorld Map - The world map is very easy to navigate and I like the ability to zoom out and change to the neighborhood view. I will often zoom out and see what is happening in my neighborhoods and see which gangs are scoping out or targeting my properties.\n\nEnemy AI - My next playthrough will be on a higher difficulty than default but the default difficulty AI was very disappointing. Their targets on the world map seem random and not coordinated. Their movements in combat as well as their target selection are also not that smart more often than not. I do not know if any of this reflects the default difficulty and I just need to play at a higher level.\n\nGang Members - The black book is a good feature and I like the ability to have your gang members have opinions of one another and also the boss character. These relationships change over time depending on actions taken and your gang members can grow to hate and even love one another. An area of improvement would be when you attack a boss safehouse and one of your gang members loves one of the enemy gang members. I like the fact that they will not target each other and will be upset or angry if you kill them but my issue is the fact that I kill every single person in the safehouse except this individual and the combat does not end. The individual refuses to flee even though they had the panic icon and I was forced to kill them which caused my gang member to leave my gang.\n\nEconomics - The gang economics revolve around Breweries producing goods that are used in the Speakeasy and Brothel. The Casino and Brothel do not need alcohol to run but alcohol can boost the efficiency of your brothel. I wish this game would incorporate the idea in the game Omerta of dirty vs clean money as well as new building types in the future. Hopefully this will be released in a future expansion. I think the game economics are pretty decent otherwise. \n\n\nI might add more to this review in the future but as it stands this game is entertaining enough to go back to in the future. The game can get repetitive which is a common comment I am seeing in the reviews. The main reason for this is you are constantly just attacking building after building. This is the tactic I chose and will win you the game but there are other things I have not tried yet such as assassinations or moles that I will try next playthrough.", "timestamp_created": 1607123887, "timestamp_updated": 1607123887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544962048530578613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81622250": {"recommendationid": "81622250", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974593220", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 977, "last_played": 1607455881}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend this game however there are still a lot of bugs that need to be fixed.

Bugs that affect vital missions, characters, and faction interactions sometimes block gameplay altogether.\n\n[b] The Good: [/b]\nSupporting a relatively independent, creative developer. Romero certainly has not lacked for screwups, but at least he does it in pursuit of a particular vision.\nThe scope of the game is interesting, though realized with wildly mixed results.\nThe art design is solid and generally fits the theme well. The effects are satisfying (sound + visual of the tommy guns for example). The only major negative here is that the generic NPCs need more variety in their appearances (even small variations in faces would go a long way).\n\n\n[b] The Bad: [/b]\nAs others have noted, the game may have a grand vision but it falls well short in execution. For example: the heavily advertised system for organic interactions between the gangsters is severely underwhelming. It might be on par with Shadow of Mordor\u2019s nemesis system (released in 2014).\nThe quality of the writing and the voice acting is all over the place. Some of it is quite good, but most of it falls somewhere between passable and sloppy. The writer(s) clearly struggled to decide between classic noir and cartoons. There is no gradual change (in both the writing and the voice acting) between somber reflection on cutthroat violence and slapstick shenanigans. It sometimes feels like someone spliced The Untouchables with Who Framed Roger Rabbit but made no effort to integrate the two. \n\n[b] The Ugly: [/b]\nWhat a horribly buggy mess. Random bugs of varying severity are littered throughout the entire game. Some are minor, like voiceover and subtitles not matching. Some are major, like generic NPCs changing their entire appearance after they are killed; voice actor and character model getting completely mismatched; occasionally parts of the interface refuse to close. The lethal bugs are scattered mainly across various quests when, for example, certain essential characters disappear, or are impossible to interact with. Usually I am not overly concerned with mentions of bugs or performance issues in reviews. Oftentimes these get fixed, assuming the game is not abandonware. The user experience can vary widely depending on hardware, and so on. However, sometimes a game\u2019s programming is so shoddy it makes it nearly or entirely unplayable no matter the user. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened here.\n\nBugs are not the only fatal flaw either. The diplomacy system between factions is such a mess it is hard to know where to begin. The worst of it revolves around the transactions. The system for valuing items (weapons, equipment, consumables) is imbalanced and easy to exploit. Specifically, the \u201cblack market\u201d (an interface panel for buying items from a non-faction store) will only buy items from you at a tiny fraction of the value. However, the other main factions will buy/trade for any item based purely on the dollar value. You can effectively run your entire empire by selling junk to the other factions, draining them of all their funds, and investing the money into your properties. You can even throw enough junk items together to trade for the faction-unique, extremely valuable weapons (the ones you otherwise can only get by killing the boss of each respective faction).\n\nI earnestly hope Romero Games and Paradox work out the bugs and revise various mechanics. I would love to be able to honestly recommend this game. They have quite a lot of work ahead of them however, and I cannot imagine Empire of Sin being worth buying for some time.\n", "timestamp_created": 1607122426, "timestamp_updated": 1607122426, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567901253700256348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81621141": {"recommendationid": "81621141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042582343", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1607159885}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is good but lacks in variety of rackets(casino,speakeasy,brothel,ect) that can be set up also lots of bugs right now that need to be flushed out and they should add some other features as the game play is fairly basic and needs more content also i don't feel its worth the $50 price tag currently for the deluxe edition and $30 is a more reasonable price for the deluxe edition due to the lack of content the game provides", "timestamp_created": 1607122393, "timestamp_updated": 1607122393, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81621126": {"recommendationid": "81621126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035145209", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1593, "last_played": 1613274270}, "language": "english", "review": "Buggy mess, I'll give it another shot later but I'm tired of making progress only to lose it with dead end missions, soft locks in combat, and infinite loading screens.

I am a big fan of Paradox also, so I always pay attention to games released by Paradox and have done so for over ten years. My first pre-game play impression was that of a somewhat in depth game with interesting mechanics however the biggest turn off was the turn based combat, which I was never a fan of. If anything, at one point i decided I wasn't going to buy this game due to the turn based mechanics but my love of gangsters organised crime, the whole genre in general and my faith that paradox always releases games with great play ability and depth, made me purchase this game. To help give an honest and structured opinion I will address each of the main points below. \n\n1) Turn based combat\n\nTo me surprise, I enjoyed the turn based combat and felt it went fluently. Some of those up close attacks that would keep missing at points is a little annoying. If the target is right in front of you, but behind a table, you should at least be hitting them with some damage each time. My only complaint is that it gets very repetitive , especially when your constantly having turn based battles. Also, your basic goons seem to have the worse aim ever, so when you go through the motions of using your 2-3 guards against an attack of 4-5, you will miss A LOT and it feels like the outcome is a forgone conclusion. The enemy can be right in front of you, and in a lot of cases you won't even nip them with the spray of a sawn off... surly it can be tweeked to work better, but it makes grunt battles very tedious. \n\nThis has opened my mind to other turn based combat games so that's also a plus!\n\n2) Strategy & management \n\nI hate to admit it, but the strategy and management aspect is lacking greatly. Sure, you find yourself planning on building more breweries if needed, choosing which one to upgrade so you can produce swill / whiskey or the needed beverage. Maybe your drawing too much heat, or your expecting a war and beef up security at interfaces so you can fight off attacks. But you will find yourself running through the motions making very basic decisions when it comes to management. \n\nOther than trading goods, diplomacy is shallow, feels pointless, and the game ends up turning into a free for all of repeating  turn based battles. After taking 2-3 rackets the enemy wants to give up and there's no personality behind the AI, all other factions simply send squads to your rackets. It would have been much better if each gang had their own methods or preferences when going to war. It seems the other real difference is the enemies colour and location. \n\nThe types of rackets you can have are extremely limited also. A speakeasy, a brewery, a casino and a brothel....... why not take a leaf from Omerta (the only leaf anyone should take from that god awful game) and add other options such as protection rackets, food joints, have celebrity areas, politicians and so on, it would have added so much more to the game in terms of strategy, rpg elements, missions and so on.\n\nAnother thing, it is also very easy to attack an enemy safe house, kill the leader and take all of their rackets. I was a half hour into one game and asked the North side mob to wack the head of the Genna family. It was promptly done and the genna empire suddenly become the northside mob. This is a bad idea... There should be a mechanic whereby the rackets in that part of the city get taken over, but the gang remains in a weakened state in the hands of the underboss. \n\nI have also played on easy and normal, it seems each gang expands very slowly and their income is always quite low. The AI needs to be a bit more aggressive and active. I am going to try it on hard next, but there was not change between easy and normal so I'm doubtful it will make much of a difference. I found I was easily able to accumalate thousands, build up my gang and just attack a bunch of rackets if the other gangs became annoying. That's all the other gangs are in this game, irritating....\n\nAs your mob gets larger, the game feels like its about turning the map into whatever color your faction is. There is very little you can do to feel like a rich, powerful mob boss. NO flashy cars, flashy homes you can customize, no clothing for characters, no personality or image you can give to your gang to make them stand out... it just feels pointless...it doesn't even feel like there is any challenge... you just rinse and repeat 1) Ransack vacant properties 2) trade the weapons for cash 3) build up rackets 4) Do it again and again. 5) If a gang attacks, then attack some of their rackets forcing them to surrender. Again and again and again..... \n\nYes, there are missions, but they fall far far short of what is needed. If your looking for a minimum of CK3 immersion then forget about it. \n\nWhy would I still recommend this game you may wonder?\n\n1) I love the genre\n2) There's a complete lack of any game like this (other than gangsters organised crime).\n3) It looks good and is somewhat enjoyable. \n4) While its hugely lacking in areas, its still okay... \n5) I had a good time playing this. \n\nBut more than anything, the more i played this game and the more i enjoyed it, the greater i felt it could have been so much better. I believe tweeks can fix some of the above (and a few bugs i came across), and I hope some DLC's come out which add more possibilities , abilities, depth, options and mission branches. As well as the chance to reflect your progress within the game in a cool manner which will motivate you. \n\nThat's my honest opinion.... \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1607119752, "timestamp_updated": 1607119752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630494236946105957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81618688": {"recommendationid": "81618688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161520530", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 766, "last_played": 1614277205}, "language": "english", "review": "not going to lie, was pretty excited to start my own crime empire. buts is kinda boring and buggy (combat glitches, players dont follow commands when moving them around the map) the acting and story is absent, but i didnt buy it for a cinematic experience. needs another 6 months and bug fixing and combat improving.\n\nupdate. i can now not play my saved game because everytime i enter combat it now prevents me from carrying out any character actions. this is any combat, different buildings etc. great...", "timestamp_created": 1607119282, "timestamp_updated": 1607120117, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81618352": {"recommendationid": "81618352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022895769", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 471, "last_played": 1607245333}, "language": "english", "review": "Edit: I have not quit this game via the menu once. It was always ALT+F4 because it locked up. I really want to like it, but it's almost unplayable.\n\n\n\nNot a great game in its current state. And since this is a full release for $40 or even $60 if you get the bigger versions, I expected a lot more from it.\n\nThe worst parts for me:\n\n- Soft locking bugs that pop up out of nowhere. If you begin a sit-down, chances are the game bugs out and you have to ALT-F4 it. If you start combat and two people have the early overwatch skill = soft lock. If there are animations that are supposed to be played, but they can't for whatever reason = soft lock. \n\n- No idea whats going on in gang wars. If you end up in one, your properties are suddenly swarmed by goons not a second later. And you can't bring you boss to a fight once it already started, leaving you with a few ill equipped guards. There is no auto-resolve, so you HAVE to fight manually 10 guys, with your 2. I also ended up in a war with some obscure faction out of nowhere, even though there was never a screen showing me this. When I tried to sit down with that faction leader to see wtf is going on, the game soft locked. \n\n- Weapon balance. Shotguns are effing useless, submachineguns overpowered.\n\n- Businesses have a weird cash flow, hard to read. But its certainly not enough money to do anything. If you want money, buy swill, disguise it as whiskey, sell it to a minor faction for brutal profits. They wont even care that you swindled them. And even if they did, they are never doing anything. \n\nThere is a solid game under the hood here, but even the simplest quality of life improvements are not available and the bugs are horrendous.

It's bad.\n\nI love gangster themed games. I have a particular love for the \"management of the business\" type of gangster game.

This game promised that, throwing in some tactical turn-based combat (which I love too), as well as characters/stories to drive forward a motivation and a story (although not necessary, as I would prefer to write my own gangster story).\n\nThis game pretends to do a lot of different things, and spectacularly fails at all of them. The \"management\" is laughable, the stories/voice acting is comically poor, and the turn-based combat is an abject failure.\nIt's still buggy too in it's early state (so these will likely be patched after the time of writing this review), I have already had to restart the game twice as certain actions were not progressing (in a 90 minute run). The pathfinding is also a joke, with characters often not moving at all, and preferring to get intimate with nearby wall. This game feel like it was made to bank on a subset of interested fanatics (people who love gangster themed games), instead of being made to satisfy a particular itch that many of us have had for years.\n\nParadox are really \"Hit and Miss\" with recent game launches. In some instances reading their target audience with lazer point precision, and others completely missing the mark and sparking anguish in their attempt. This one is a bit of a step too far for me.

Quests flow in. Events kick off.  Your personal economy moves. Gangs interact. All of these with such speed and low visibility that I feel, as a gang leader, that I am practically blind. Me as a player feels the same as well. It feels like as a gang leader I would do more planning. That these actions that I and my allies/rivals take would be over weeks, not hours and days. I recruit a bunch of guys, target a speakeasy, and then go into a sitdown with the guy i stole it from all within one day at a whirlwind pace? Yikes. This leads me into my next point.\n\nThe game feels too shallow:  I feel like the world just doesn't respond or care what i do except if I specifically step on someone's road (this is annoying. imagine if just walking on a road necessitated a massive sitdown with a rival gang leader), or attack their stuff. Do my people that I recruit matter except for a reminder to choose the next skill? No. Can I really choose in a meaningful way who gets recruited in my game in a personality, ethnicity, or loyalty manner? Nope. Imagine a game about gangs that doesn't involve nurturing the local young people in your neighborhood to join the gang, instead just picking a name off a large list. Does my headquarters actually feel like a headquarters? Not really, its just a place the game directs me to. My gang doesnt feel like an empire. It truly just feels like some shallow game mechanics that someone tied together via UI.\n\nThe windup and customization for the start doesn't feel good: This is huge for me. Anyone playing another paradox game, XCOM, or any other grand strategy knows that the first few hours of play are just a really defining and enjoyable time. Its how you build your personality for the rest of the game. And Empire of Sin REALLY struggles to make the beginning of the game feel like a true beginning besides the starting quest and conversation. It isn't really defined against the rest of the game, in any real meaningful way that gives it personality, or that I can own as a player. \n\n>> It feels like a board game, not a story. <<\n\nIm reading cards and rules and optimally picking choices that let me win instead of anything that would excite me to own.\n\nI read the statement the Romero's put out, and thats cool.

When it was first announced, I was hoping for a spiritual successor to the old Gangsters series, as more information came out, it looked more like an XCOM type game.  I'm not sure what they were hoping for with the game, but the end result fails at everything.\n\nCOMBAT\nThe combat plays out in an Xcom style, but the AI is stupidly dumb.  Poor AI combined with random start positions makes combat very cheesy and not at all tactical.  Cover and LOS are wonky as well- i've had situations where there's clearly a wall between me and my enemy, but it'll still allow me to shoot them with a high hit chance.  It's poor combat, but that could be excused if the management portion of the game were solid and combat was just a distraction; unfortunately, the mediocre implementation of combat is consistent with the quality of the rest of the game.\n\nMANAGEMENT\nThe management is very shallow.  There's about 5 building types, and you're really just making booze to turn around and sell to get cash to buy take your other buildings through a very boring/basic upgrade tree.  The upgrades for buildings manage to be even more boring than vanilla CK2 demense constructions.\n\nOVERALL\nI almost stopped playing after 3 hours, it just wasn't holding my interest and felt like a chore.  I wanted so bad to like this, however, that I kept on plugging away- trying different starting bosses, different strategies, just seeing if there was something I was missing.

Bought the game on release day & have been playing it since. The aesthetic is impressive, I have to admit. The swanky 20's music gives the game a real classy vibe & makes it seem like you're really back during the prohibition era. The combat system took a little getting used to but by no means difficult to utilize. However, I found myself constantly bombarded with sit-down/non-aggression pacts/protection requests within seconds of each other. I'm not able to actually enjoy the game because I'm being attacked several consecutive times, and I'm only playing normal difficulty. It feels like I'm not able to focus on improving my rackets or crew member stats because there is always some pop up demanding that I dissolve my connection with a faction or I missed a sit-down. This prevents me from getting immersed into the game, and becomes more of a nuisance than anything else. The map UI isn't intuitive or user friendly. Having to pan to each city instead of a drop down list where I can click a city name would be useful. If I scroll too far out, I lose sight of my mission/crew markers forcing me to zoom back in so I can remember who is in what city and then zoom out so I can find the city I need to go to, and then zoom into that city so I can set my destination. It's a headache and I detest the way it's set up. The missions don't always complete properly. On more than one occasion, I have performed required tasks and upon completion, the objectives menu incorrectly shows that the objective was never completed even though a mission successful notification populates. The tutorial misses a few key points like the use of taxi's to travel from city to city. I learned this on my own but it would have saved me time if it was in the tutorial. Overall, the game is enticing at first & I love the voice acting but the constant pops up detract from the over all experience & the map system is just a hassle.

I really like the graphics, I like that there are so many characters with a fairly distinctive feel to them, and I like the whole gangster theme. But the things that I like don't alter the fact that, whilst it can be enjoyable Empire of Sin is ultimately severely limited.\n\nTake the strategic/business layer as a prime example; on the one hand it is well thought out with several ways to improve your economy and your individual business security. But it all means nothing in a game where you don't really need much money meaning that you can almost ignore the whole layer for most of the game. Likewise the Diplomacy and Faction elements - why bother with them at all when you can simply storm everyone's main safehouse, kill the Boss, and take over all their businesses?\n\nI played for 10 hours on the next to hardest (underboss) difficulty just steamrollering over everyone and plucking their juicy equipment from their cold dead hands. It didn't matter which boss I started with despite the fact that they have well designed traits and special abilities due to the fact that it is entirely possible to kill everyone with only basic attacks and tactics. The enemy AI rarely makes use of cover or flanking tactics and I just felt that it didnt represent any kind of serious challenge.\n\nEven though the framework for an excellent game is there the game as it stands is broken on so many different levels. Police presence is fairly low even when things start to heat up and when the police get caught up in a crossfire between other factions it is easy to see how utterly broken the AI is as they do nothing but retreat without contributing anything significant - so all the elements of keeping a low profile and bribing the cops are a complete waste of time.\n\nChanging to the hardest difficulty only means that no matter how many guards you add to improve the security of your buildings enemy guards will have more hp and be better equipped. So the phases where you have to defend solely with guards may as well be skipped (and it is frustrating that battles within your properties CANNOT be skipped when you have very little chance of winning despite that the outside battles CAN). But, hey, none of it matters anyway because you get everything you lose back just by attacking and winning the boss fight. This essentially means that you only really need to play a single fight to defeat each faction in the game. This being the case I just can't recommend this game to the majority of players for long term play.\n\nAll the quest chains and character interrelationships are fun and sometimes interesting and it''s great that seemingly minor companion quests can gain you a massive edge by linking you to a far superior character. But, again, all this is a hollow enjoyment when the core gameplay is fundamentally flawed. There's no doubt that it's still fun - to a point. It's just a real shame that all the groundwork for something with real depth is rendered shallow by a few core issues. Will I play and enjoy it more? Sure but that doesn't mean I can honestly recommend a game that presents only an illusion of strategic depth, an illusion that is quickly dispelled by just a couple of serious problems resulting in only a \"casual\" game.\n\nOf course there's still plenty of time for the developers to address these problems...", "timestamp_created": 1607107617, "timestamp_updated": 1607108335, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550172984600067139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81607909": {"recommendationid": "81607909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073811463", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 457, "last_played": 1607617560}, "language": "english", "review": "WAY TOO EXPENSIVE SHOULD BE EA\n\nTitle says it all. At its current state, the game is way too expensive. I wouldn't give more than 15, maybe 20 euros for it. I have played early access games who where cheaper and with less bugs than this game! A shame, because in essence it is a fun and nice game. If it were an EA title and around 20 euros, then this game would be a good start and recommended. I like the graphics and the gameplay is okay. Has a nice feel to it. But seeing that there are already two DLC's announced, the game looks more like a money cow than a good game which was ready for launch.

Set a good atmosphere and ambiance\n- Nice music/sound\n- Selection of bosses is good (with their own traits and abilities)\n- Quite a few neighbourhoods/districts to take over\n- Seemingly a lot of missions and side missions (can also be a con, for sometimes it feels like you are drowning in missions and side missions and therefore preoccupied from taking over other NPC's and/or businesses and neighbourhoods\n- Combat has some decent options and ways to go about.

Dear developers, when something works (XCOM series) there's no shame in copying it and tweaking it slightly. There's no point in adding features upon features upon features which end up not making any sense together. \n\nPositives: \n- Really nice music\n- I do like the character presentations and their diversity.

Of course this is something which might be fixed in the future but you know...I'm sick and tired of paying top price money to get a beta. At least label it as an early release and price it accordingly. \n- I totally dislike the real time element that is built within the city view. It's confusing and it doesn't allow me to plan for stuff. \n- Diplomacy is bland, time consuming and you can play without it\n- Questing feels bland\n- Empire management is problematic. They've tried to do too many things and failed at all of them. There's too much to optimize and it's unclear how everything fits together. \n- Scrolling in and out of the map can get glitzy at times.

If you don't want to read further its not great just now, you could play it for a few hours before putting it aside, and is not in its current state worth the asking price.\n\nIt looks good, the music is good, the whole premise of the game is great, but it lacks any real depth.\n\nThe combat is okay, a decent variety of skills and weapons, generally enjoyable clicking away and ending folk.\n\nThe Diplomacy is neither here nor there, just don't piss anyone off to much on the way up and you will be okay. Once you are strong enough you can just ignore what others think.\n\nThe economy, what there is of it, I think its workable as is. There just is not a lot of incentive to upgrade and build tall and again it lacks any real depth or variety. After a while you run out of stuff to spend the cash on.\n\nIts buggy, not the worst I have played, but crashes a fair amount during missions and when you are interacting with people. Some you can sort just by leaving and coming back, others screw the game and if you don't save it before hand then its back to the auto save, which is frustrating if you have paused the game and done a fair amount with your businesses, gangsters and diplomacy in the interim.\n\nI would like to see them improve the game in terms of the type of illegal businesses you can set up, illegal money presses that kind of thing, it would also be interesting to be able to buy legitimate businesses to diversify your income, and have to balance illegal vs legal  income or face a greater level of suspicion from the Feds.\n\nIn terms of spending the cash you make, it would be great if you could invest in other things like vehicles, which self respecting mob boss does not have a decent motor! All you can do just now is take a taxi! It would be nice if you could set up your own booze distribution network, which you would need vehicles and underlings for. \n\nOn the underlings side of things (your mob gangsters aside), all you can have is guards, you can't even directly influence how they are armed (Or if you can I have not found out how to yet) . Again there is so much room for more here, intimidating and extorting your neighbourhoods for cash in exchange for protection (there in an element of this with the minor factions, but its so minimal). And loads of other underling things like distributing booze, patrolling keeping peeps safe, exploring, robbing banks whatever it is.

It has a poor ill planned UI, bugs and lacks a lot of content you would expect of a game of this price.\n\nI would buy this game but only when on sale (50%+ or around \u00a320-\u00a315) and maybe not then tbh.\n\nLong version:\nThe game is set in 1920\u2019s prohibition Chicago and as you probably seen this but, you play a gangster trying to take over the city against AI rivals. The visual style is appealing and there is some good voice acting and music. The combat system is the turn-based X-COM style that\u2019s became popular on the Unreal engine. Generally speaking, these aspects of the game that are very appealing to me and something I could spending a lot of time playing and enjoying. However, there are several aspects of the game limited my enjoyment-\n\nFirstly bugs and crashes, they are there and in abundance unfortunately. As of yet there has been no patch (that I know of) to address these nor communication from the developer or the publisher to manage everyone\u2019s expectations on when these will be addressed which is a shame. \n\nSecondly the game content. I\u2019ve played this game for just over 13 hours and whilst I\u2019m planning on playing more of the game (just so I can say I've \u2018completed\u2019 it), I don\u2019t expect my experiences to change substantially. The side missions are pointless, lack flavour and are very, very repetitive of the game\u2019s main mechanics i.e. go there, talk to this guy, fight this guy (and maybe his friends), go there, talk to this guy, fight this guy etc etc. \n\nThe empire building exists of attacking \u2018thugs\u2019 (squatters in unused buildings) or attack other ganged own properties and that\u2019s it. Which gets very repetitive very quickly. There is no need to identify potential buildings for illegal use or understand the illegal market needs for a brewery, brothel or casino in the neighbourhood. Your empire actions are limited to setting up these establishments in the neighbourhoods also. There is no need option to create \u2018protection\u2019 rackets take over legal business to launder money, no dealing in anything else but drink. Basically, it's setting up buildings and that\u2019s it. \n\nEmpire Management is also virtually none existent. You can upgrade most of the buildings in certain generic areas (like security, type of or amount of drink etc). There\u2019s nothing else. For example, moving your guards from establishment A to B to meet potential threats, creating scouting parties or protection parties looking for enemies or police in a neighbourhood doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nYou can create a gang for you to run around the map with. Whilst each of these characters have their own back story, of which some are interesting and linked to some quests they can seriously break immersion. You and the AI\u2019s have a set amount of characters to pick from but it\u2019s a small pool and when they die, they are gone. Also, they have restrictions to hire which limits the pool even further. So, whilst you want to create a group of 3 or 4 Italians or Irish (or whatever culture you want to play as), you can\u2019t. With my Italian \u2018themed\u2019 play I was forced to run around with an elderly Irish lady, a fat half clothed (southern American I think), an Indian Hindu, an Irish drunk and a Chinese lady. How can you pretend to be Ali Capone and the Italian mob taking over Chicago when your pool of side kicks has been chosen by the Race Equality Commission? Why couldn\u2019t they just implement a procedurally generated pool of side kicks based on your background (if you\u2019re the Irish mob, your enforcers will mostly likely be Irish!) with a couple \u2018oddballs\u2019 thrown in?\n\nThe RPG element is very, very limited. Yes, you can equip your guys with weapons and items, and choose from skills to give the illusion of customisation. But in reality, this is very bare bones also. When you get an epic item it stays, you can\u2019t customise weapons, nor your crews apperances, nor specialise down a certain path. RPG elements impact heavily on immersion and mechanics somewhat too. For example, you can get a Rosary that increases your initiative by 10, your health by 15% and increases defence skills by 5. Whereas weapons mods like increasing drum size for your submachine gun or sights, gun cleaning equipment, outfits (i.e police, smart, worker outfits) are missing. \n\nThe games economy is also very skewed. For example, to run 2 hotels cost circa $10 per week but to buy a baseball bat (?!) for one of your crew to use in melee costs $6,725. I don\u2019t understand what decisions developers took to come up with this economic scale but it\u2019s ridiculous and feels like they were developed in silos.\n\nThis game had lots of potential.

I'm sure the bugs will be patched out at some point as the majority of the ones I have encountered are just graphical bugs that don't effect gameplay. The other two are annoyances. Being that sometimes enemies will spawn outside of the combat map and be unaccessable and untargetable. Requiring you to leave the combat zone and reenter to fight again. The second is that sometimes you will not be able to move without looking at your characters on the world map outside of combat.\n\nEmpire of Sin is a strategy game in which you take control of a mob boss and build your empire while competing with other bosses and some minor factions. The turn based combat is much like any XCOM game as well as Paradox's Age of Wonders: Planetfall. The goal of the game is simple. Be the last boss standing. You can achieve this through guile or sheer brute force. Gang up on a faction with your allies and divvy up the loot. Or just rush their safehouse with your top gangsters. Each boss has their own unique storyline to do on the side while taking over Chicago. Along with various side missions thrown in along the way. There are five gangster classes not including your respective boss. They are Enforcer, Hired Gun, Demolitionist, Doctor, and Conman. Each serves their own purpose and has their own skill tree. All of them are pretty self explanatory. Enforcers are your front-line pretty much. They can suppress, take reduced damage, counter melee strikes, and usually have a higher health pool. Hired guns are one of the two damage dealers. They pretty much just sling [b] A LOT [/b] of lead. Demolitionists bring the [b] BOOM!!! [/b] They have access to skills that allow them to throw explosives that can put out some massive hurt if the enemy dares to clump up. Every mob needs a Doctor on the take of course. They heal your team passively out of combat, in combat they provide heals as well as reviving downed gang members. This is quite important as your gang members have a chance to be injured if they take too much damage in combat which will require them to heal for a set amount of days making them unavailable for use. Last but not least our sneaky friends the Conmen. They can pickpocket enemies to take their things and once they receive their final talent they turn into the chain killing sniper one might see in XCOM if specced right and given the right gear.\n\nHowever, while the game might be fun it is not without its downsides. I have encountered several bugs during my time playing this game since release. The two major bugs causing the game to just not work the way it is intended to. The first one that causes me the most irritation personally is movement bugging out when using the overhead map or just when walking around Chicago. At times the game just simply will not move your characters unless you are looking at them and following them with the camera. This means you cannot play using the City map consistently. Which the game makes a point to tell you that you can play the [b] ENTIRE GAME [/b] using!!! The second major bug is that when you go into some buildings to take over one of the enemies will spawn out in what I like to call, \"The Void\". They spawn out in the darkened out areas of the combat map that signifies out of bounds. You cannot target them with [b] ANY [/b] abilities, attacks, or items. This causes you to have to escape combat, which will take your crew back to the nearest safehouse, require you to return to said place you were attacking, and start all over. This has caused many an angry glare at my monitor early on. There is nothing more annoying than fighting an entire fight to find out that JERRY IS HIDING WHERE NO ONE CAN GET HIM!!!! The rest of the bugs are minor graphical bugs, characters just floating across the map instead of walking, delays in animations, or no animations at all. \n\nIn conclusion I personally love this game. I'm a sucker for any game that deals with organized crime. I am confident that the bugs will be dealt with through patches as they are pretty basic and core things that need to be fixed. If you in any way, shape, or form enjoy XCOM's combat, resource management like Stellarris, and an organized crime setting. I have no doubt that you will enjoy this game regardless of the bugs. Thank you for reading my review, and I hope that it has helped you in some way decide whether or not to purchase this, in my opinion, amazing game. Have a great day and remember, be kind to one another.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1607095868, "timestamp_updated": 1607095868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573705613613128662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81597315": {"recommendationid": "81597315", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967991890", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 415, "last_played": 1607375283}, "language": "english", "review": "Empire of Sin is a fun and well made game.

On paper it is exactly what I wanted. A strategic, turn based combat manager set in the 1920 gangster world. \nYou have a chance to grow and customize your empire and gang. The premise is perfect and not enough developers have made games like this.\nThe game gets the music and graphics right, the city looks nice and music is good enough to match.\nUnfortunately, it gets a lot more wrong.\nOne of the biggest issues I encountered are bugs. This game is the buggiest game I have played in an awfully long time and was clearly not finished. Bugs range from the boss continuously getting stuck in the shooting animation (the only way to fix this as of now is to initiate a physical attack, reloading or exiting the game does not help) to main objectives or npcs disappearing, to not being able to select a dialogue option. In 2 days, I had to restart the campaign 3 times and now I am over it. Not tested and unpolished.\nAnother issue I have is with the combat, if you are using your main crew it is too easy (even on higher difficulties). Your boss\u2019 ability is completely overpowered and right from the first battle can take down 2-3 enemies in one turn. Another problem with combat is that the developers have decided to not include an auto resolve for when other gangs attack your buildings, which I could be ok if I could at least use my crew, but instead you are forced to use randomly generated characters that were in the building as protection. You do not choose security, you cannot customize security, you can only add more of it. This is where I had enough. This is not fun, you are using bland characters that you are not invested in, that have weapons you may not like.\nThis is also where another issue became clear as daylight. GAME IMMERSION. Meaning the nice graphics, music and city are totally nullified by the fact that this is yet another 2020 game that had to go to diversity training. The randomly generated crew and enemies are perfectly balanced between all races, genders and body types. Every time you are forced to use the randomly generated security (which is a lot) be prepared to fight with a body positive, shotgun wielding woman vs a body positive, shotgun wielding woman of color etc. This is supposed to be 1920, not 2020, not 2050. The crime families (like it or not) were specific. There were Italian gangs, Irish gangs, black gangs and Jewish gangs. I\u2019m sure there were women gangsters too, but gangs were not this perfectly balanced 2020 BS.\nThe game interface is also clunky, the overall gameplay is extremely repetitive and gets boring fast.\nI wanted this game to be good, on paper it should have been good but once again we have a game that is ruined because it is unfinished, unpolished and full of identity politics. True shame. I hope city of gangsters by Kalypso does not disappoint.

There's the shell of an excellent game here, but it's such a mess at the moment - its core is rotten. \n\nI'd like to think that given more time they can fix this but.... where do you start? You ever play a game and just get that feeling that it's the base mechanics of the game that are screwed? It's like that.

I so want this game to be good.\n\nThe AI is atrocious. \nThe management is somehow far too simplistic and yet confusing at the same time.\nThe Diplomacy may as well not be there. It's got some fun ideas, but it's completely pointless.\nVariety is extremely limited - in the neighbourhoods, in the playstyles, in the limited rackets, in your gangsters... it all LOOKS like interesting variations, but it all doesn't really matter.\nThat's not mentioning all the little annoyances - Melee is pointless (if you run over and stab an enemy, they can just back up a bit and shoot you in the face. Most other games have melee locks, or attacks of opportunity when moving out of melee?!), the AI can send guards to attack you, but you can't really do that to them, so if you get into a gang war, you feel more reactive than proactive. There's no win condition other than \"kill everyone.\" Just... on and on and on.\n\nAnd all of that could be fixed. It's all stuff that can be repaired, sure... but there's a worrying, foreboding feeling nonetheless that even with all that, it still won't be very good. Like I said, the core is rotten.

Wait for a couple patches and the game is probably worth 20USD (IMO)\n\nGame looked like it had alot of potential, reminded me of a game I used to play back in the day called \"gangland\"\n\nI didnt watch any videos on the game or reviews from others (my mistake), just happen to find it randomly on steam. Bugs and bugs everywhere to the point that it is borderline unplayable. \n\nPros: \n\n- Great looking game! different intros and personalities of each character!\n- Management and battle simplistic, anyone can just jump right in. \n- Plenty of side missions to keep the game rolling.\n- Potential expansion packs to add in new characters\n- Great music!\n\nCons:\n\n- Wayy too many bugs as of current build. Here are what I found after playing three hours : \n     - Enemies walking through walls ( probably animation problems ) \n     - When performing executions, the game just skips a round rather than performing it.\n     - Game states that everything can be done through the map view, however theres a bug that doesnt allow you to move while in said view mode. I had to zoom in and move them a few meters at a time, if you click to far, they just stand there. \n     - Playing as Frank, after getting the passive from his melee, attempted to melee another the next round (not having triggered the passive), he just stood there next to the enemy not doing anything forcing me to load a previous save round\n     - Meeting other mobsters, made a deal and they instantly break the deal after making them. \n     - not sure if this is a bug or just my luck, most of my 80 - 90 % hit chance is a miss.\n     - When triggering a battle in public, the whole section joins in the battle and freezes the game after 1 round\n     - Leaving a venue through map view, when zoomed in I was still stuck in the venue unable to zoom in to outside.\n\n     Im sure I ran into alot more, just cant remember from the top of my head. \n\n-  Game seemed repetitive, doesnt look like it does anything more than just taking joints and upgrading them with the occasional side missions for companions. However, I've only played three hours and gave up coz of the bugs. \n- Animation in flunky for this generation of gaming. During talks, characters just swings their heads and move their mouths. During battle, after killing units, their clothes change. Also, when doing a melee ( like kicking the leg before hitting the head) the enemy just stands there and drops.\n- Lacking in customization. The armors dont change looks, just the same thing throughout the game. \n- Poor UI for management screen. \n- Poor gang information UI. It took me a while to find out what my notoriety level was at. \n- Poor outside of combat mechanics. No inventory map in order to use items on characters. I had to enter ambush mode and heal them one by one. \n- no fast forward button, just play and pause. You have to wait and stand there to recieve your monthly income. \n- Having to memorize everything as when you make deals, there is no way of looking at what you own currently and how the deal affects your business. \n\nLoads of problems in the game as of now. Its not stated as a early access so, if this is the game build than stay away from it for a while. \n\nOpinion for buyers :\nIf a few patches come out to fix the bugs and gameplay, I'd say it's worth 20USD no more.\n", "timestamp_created": 1607088143, "timestamp_updated": 1607096087, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536237776279449463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81589878": {"recommendationid": "81589878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017075595", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1501, "last_played": 1607211976}, "language": "english", "review": "Game just too empty what to do.

The 1920s Chicago gangster theme is amazing and having the ability to hire some of the most well known gangsters from the time period is cool. The music and catchy 20s phrases set the atmosphere. The game is not without flaws though. The main issue comes from the missions as I have run into several story missions that get stuck and stop progressing. This left me guessing where to go next. The missions randomly cleared when doing other tasks such as taking out a rival gang or taking over buildings. \n\nThe other thing noticed which may be an issue for some is how OP the AI accuracy appears. The enemies seem to make every shot even under full cover while my gangster miss most shot even at point blank range (Insert clever XCOM reference \u0ca0_\u0ca0) or back to back on a light post when I have a 90%+ hit rate and misses while the AI blasts me in the face without a single missed shot. Or in full cover and the enemy rifleman from across the map headshots my characters while my rifleman lands 1 out of 6 shots with 100+ marksmanship. The AI tends to run into the middle of the street out in the open a lot as well (and still miss them with 98% (\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0\uff09\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b).\n\nAt the end of the day I feel like a mob boss making hooch and hookers and other sinful pleasures while stomping out the competition for the betterment of the people and the city.

How do I have a full house but not a pair...and what does that even do for a hotel? How much does my protection stat even do? Is it good or bad?\n- Diplomacy is worthless. Other gangs will make arrangements with you, saying something like, \"You're good at casinos and I'm good at brewing. Let's help each other.\" And then you agree to a bonus of 2-4% cheaper upgrades or production...but you don't give up anything for this. And then gang's will break them for no reason and get mad at you if you have other arrangements, but never tell you.\n- Money is so dumb. Part of the game has \"realistic\" prices -- a gang will buy a barrel of booze from you for $4 a week or your upkeep on the place is $17 a week. But then a grenade costs $2,300. Your rackets will make very little money each week, and by the time you pay your hired guns, you aren't profiting much, if at all. And then, you'll get a quest that just rewards you with 50k for no work. So why am I even improving my rackets?\n- There's little RPG to it. Once you hire a gang member, their stats will never go up; only gear might improve a stat, but usually they are battle related.\n- The bugs are frustrating. At least they can start to work on these. Quest NPCs who just disappear, so you can never finish it. Animations stalling and adding minutes to battles. Allied gangs in wars attacking your folks.\n- No idea what influences the hit percentage. Sure, getting closer with a shotgun is better, but I have to be across the screen to shoot a rifle with an 80% chance? Is my enemy good at evading?\n- Can't look at enemy info ever (and can't see your own during battle). I'd like to know what I'm up against.\n- The gang members you can hire are always the same. So you're gonna start with the same 3 people just about every time.\n\nThe Good:\n- A ton of different gang leaders, each with a different focus and special ability. I do want to try each of them.\n- Combat can be pretty cool, grid and cover system are solid.\n- Dialogue/Story can be interesting, and figuring out if you're getting swindled is a nice touch.\n\nIt's possible to go in and change these things for the better.

Oh, this being unable to continue the quest chain also locks me out of the game, as I can't bring up the menu to exit the game. I have to force-quit the game from TASK MANAGER.\n\nIn my first playthrough, I killed a rival boss only to have that boss contact me from the beyond the grave and ask for a truce. I accepted, as I thought this would move things along for him and myself. Nope, turns out doing that just locks me out of my safe house, unable to even enter it so that I can upgrade it.

I am a fan of many of paradoxes games and the main draw for all of their games is that there is no main story, but it is a roleplaying strategy game. If you love paradox for that game and this time period you will enjoy this game. I also think my review is more positive because I did not follow the development of this game as I have begun to do in general.\n\nAs much as I am enjoying this game it is not without its flaws.\n\nThe combat is at times disappointing and cumbersome. There is very little squad-based strategy. When you are grinding money against the thugs that occupy abandoned buildings often times you just set your troops behind a cover and shoot the enemies as they come towards you. As you get the late game this becomes more and more of the case. In my first game when I was eliminating other gangs I would just sit at the entrance of their rackets and just wait for everyone to come to me. A nice fix would be to add mini objectives or something like a toggleable timer before the police show up.\n\nI have played two games one on the middle difficulty and once on the hardest difficulty. The hardest is quite hard, but unless you want a cutthroat start you would play the easier difficulties. When you hit the end game there seems to be very little that the enemies do to adapt to your strong parties. The AI still sends out little parties to attack the weakest points without sending large groups to try and attack your powerful bars or breweries. My first game felt like cat and mouse chasing away other factions as they could attack a dozen of my rackets at once while I could maybe split up my experienced crew to attack 2 rackets at a time. \n\nThere are a number of minor bugs that never got in the way of my gameplay once, but the exploits are quite overpowering. One thing you can do is buy all the other gangs cheap beer and then sell it to other factions that have infinite money as higher tier alcohol. There is no penalty for lying about the type of drink, but you get massive profits in return. This needs to be nerfed because you can get insane amounts of money for a few clicks. Another exploit has to do with arming your gangsters with other faction's unique and powerful weapons. I think it is intended for you to pick up super powerful guns when you kill other gang bosses, but you can buy their OP rifle for 2 baseball bats and some gangster pocket change. In my first game, I went and bought all the special guns and then just blasted through everything in my way. If you combined this with the right characters you could potentially kill 5 or 6 people with your boss just as combat starts. The only serious potential bug I got happened when another boss took over the safe house of another boss. Normally the winning gang would absorb the other and they would cease to exist. But two gangs managed to live on without any rackets. From there they would continue to pester me until I attacked the gang boss that originally attacked them before they would disappear. \n\nAs I said before, if you like to roleplay, the time period, and strategy games this will be a great pick. If you are worried about the issues that I have brought up I would recommend playing a smaller map with more bosses on a higher difficulty and not doing any of the exploits. This balances the game quite a lot in my opinion and keeps the games short and avoids causing you to chase enemies around.", "timestamp_created": 1607046369, "timestamp_updated": 1607046369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81559871": {"recommendationid": "81559871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320644449", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1617311810}, "language": "english", "review": "Paradox has done it again with this one.", "timestamp_created": 1607044297, "timestamp_updated": 1607044297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427627474069595337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81559708": {"recommendationid": "81559708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237163792", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 936, "last_played": 1614900931}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr: wait until patches for this one, but keep an eye on it. The potential is there. \n\nThis is my second review for this game. The first was fueled by disappointment and too much Mountain Dew (if that's even possible), and I don't think I was being entirely fair. I still say you should wait for major tweaking and bug fixes, but there are good game bones here. The stories are well written and even in my frustration with the game I want to see how the different storylines play out. The bosses feel unique from each other when you interact with them, and there are some sweet historical items to pick up. With that being said, here are the suggestions I'm taking to the forums:\n\nThe most important thing: they need to open up the workshop. Mods will go a long way to smoothing the rough edges and calming the community while Romero Games gets updates ready. \n\nFaster combat and attack alerts: any fight with more than a handful of AIs is... well, it's boring. You spend a lot of time watching your enemies, their enemies, their enemies' allies, random thugs, and someone's grandma move around the environment (usually into the line of fire, which is helpful). It's okay in smaller groups but becomes messy in a crowded area. Looking out for hit squads and marks on your buildings is helpful, but a way to speed combat up altogether would be better. \n\nBalance the economy: the Spiffing Brit *sips tea in salute* put up an exploit video about how to tank the economy, and if you do that the game becomes much easier. If you play it straight, it's still unbalanced but in a different way. Sometimes it feels like you're getting $1 a week and saving up for a console while the neighbor got their kid two consoles and all the latest games; other times your character apparently has a money tree in the backyard. I can say that finishing my boss' storyline gave me a huge chunk of money and more rackets, so I should have finished it much earlier than I did. I imagine other bosses would be the same. \n\nSpace out the content more: the game tries to get you going in so many directions at once that it becomes frustrating. It's hard to get immersed in one storyline when you have three others and a sudden gang war pulling at your attention too. The UI could also be more intuitive... there's lots of information there, but usually not what you need where you want it. \n\nI gave up on this game briefly (hence the first review) but now I'm actually looking forward to updates in the hope that the gameplay will match the writing and environments.

I love XCOM and I happen to Mafia theme stuff, lastly I see this game is made with Paradox who made Stellaris and that game is awesome, So I just HAD to get this game. I've not played much as of writing this review, I might edit it further down the line as I learn more and more details both good and bad but already this game is proving to be very fun and addictive, albeit it with several flaws.\n\nQuick Warning for those who may be looking for a Mafia/XCOM mix. Don't go into this thinking its EXACTLY like XCOM in combat execution at face value. Yes it has cover system, aim system and etc, but its more akin to XCOM Chimera Squad.  You don't have a turn, then an enemy turn, its character initiative based. So do not be fooled into thinking otherwise! I don't think its a bad thing, I like Chimera Squad also, but I do understand not everyone is into it.\n\nWith that out of the way let's break this down as best as I am able.\n\nThis game is a Mafia empire building, pseudo open world with a top down view, running in real time sporting a combat system heavily based off of XCOM. In my experience I'd say its slightly more akin to the original syndicate games or Satelitte Reign where you manage a small group that grows in power, getting more loot and tools to help you go up against growing enemies.\n\nThe world is pretty vast, broken up into neighbourhoods where characters, NPCs and mobsters will all do their own thing. Its entirely possible to run into a complete badass in the middle of the street just walking along. or in a bar and such. Its actually kinda cool the game keeps tabs on people roaming about freely while you run about running your businesses. Its like a much weaker variant of the recent Watch Dogs Legion where you find anyone of interest and keep tabs on them, sure you won't be able to play as them but still its an impressive little attention to detail that you can kinda do that to some degree in this game.\n\nYou'll be mostly spending your time running from spot to spot, doing either A. Raiding a racket to take it over/or plunder it. Or B. Trying to get to a point on the map to do a mission before something or someone gets in your way. At first its pretty easy going but as the game gets on its gonna happen a lot more frequently to the point you might be running yourself ragged trying to deal with every little message/attack that comes on screen. Honestly, between combat and generally upgrading your businesses this is what you'll be doing the majority of your time. If your not keen on the idea of being constantly bothered you may end up disliking this gameplay loop, so you'll need to learn to love the combat and theme if your to endure for the long haul, so its understandable if your not into it.\n\nHonestly, The theme and setting of this game is the best part about it. The music, the environment, the voice acting and brief moments of cutscenes via the sitdowns are really well done, if not limited. It really does get the feel down lovingly. There is also batches of humour scattered about which also fit in oddly enough, but I'm not gonna mention them so you can learn it for yourself.\n\nCombat as mentioned earlier is almost a complete carbon copy of XCOM Chimera Squad. However unlike Chimera Squad, it lacks the polish. Not that it doesn't look good when it works, it even has some sweet animations when you execute someone with various characters, the guns sound good you use the tile system as normal......but then bugs will set in. They don't ruin the game completely, but they do get annoying. I've already had a soft lock occur twice because I tried to melee someone after switching a weapon forcing reloads. Animation can bug out, sometimes characters glitch out their actions and remain in a perfectly sitting position as they suddenly float to where you say and then proceed to fire a shotgun from their knees. As said they mostly doing ruin the game, even make it funny but they do however get irritating that they usually last until you close and reopen the game.\n\nDiplomacy is....well its as you can probably imagine in most games involving it. Either the AI is dumb, or you can exploit it to high hell and not nesscesarily in that order. This game has both types. but it genuinely offers an interesting system, entering business partnerships or managing to worm your way slowly into the police's good books.\n\nRunning the empire itself is basic enough to understand though you might be overwhelmed at a glance, but once you've ran with it for a bit you'll know what's what. I won't go into details because I'm dure you'll agree you'll end up running into what I said earlier, you'll be running to a point to upgrade or expand, then something of interest or not, will pop up, or you'll be attacked, or approached, or something. Anything that prevents a clean cut approach usually to getting needed business details over with. At first its not an issue, but as the game goes on it will get hectic.\n\nLoot is random for the most part, which you get by raiding businesses to customize your mobsters, you won't be able to change their clothes and such though sadly. The mobsters themselves do have near little missions which can genuinely be a lot of fun to go through which also helps you get connected to them both in gameplay terms and as a person. my funniest encounter is a mobster of mine falling in love with a woman, wanting help with a date and asking me to ensure they don't drink, getting progressively more funny as they keep trying to get one before it turns out its actually a hit on them more or less. Its little things like that which do flesh out the NPCs which as said before they do their own thing helping the game's life so to speak.\n\nI only wanted to write a little bit, but there really is a lot to bring up the more I think about it so you know what to expect.  The game is fun, addictive, set well but suffers from bugs, lack of polish and mostly easy AI, with spikes on occasion.\n\nIt might sound like I'm bashing on the game, but these are nothing a bit of fixing can't sort. I'm being honest so any curious purchasers from the time of this aren't surprised if they decide to step into this game. The game has issues, but I'm still enjoying it which is why I can recommend it but ONLY if your willing to look past the issues, if not, you might wanna wait for a sale or something.", "timestamp_created": 1607040296, "timestamp_updated": 1607040296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.33979383111000061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81557211": {"recommendationid": "81557211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083015391", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1299, "last_played": 1607027650}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun, but there's no challenge.

Similar to fellow players, I went from excited and pre-order to utter disappointment and astonishment.\n\nParadox - how could you let this happen? To us and to your reputation.\n\nMaybe there is still hope to fix this mess. Here are some points that might help.\n\n1. Bring more differentiation to the bosses in terms of gameplay\n\u2028To be fair, their special combat abilities create some kind of uniqueness. But the empire traits/bonuses like a +20% here and a -5% there have no tangible influence whatsoever.\n\n2. Reduce the businesses and make them actually meaningful\u2028\nTen neighbourhoods with somewhere around 30 rackets each is way too much. Soon, you own so many business that you don\u2019t care about any of them. They are just numbers on an Excel list.\n\n3. Enable visible and meaninful customization for the businesses/rackets\u2028\nYou basically level up the same 4 traits for every business you have. There is no meaningful decision or differentiation. And the gap between earnings and costs for one upgrade look rather steep, especially if you consider that all you get is the next segment on a donut chart being colored.\n\n4. Enable us to understand the economy system\n\u2028It seems there are different aspects to be considered, but it doesn\u2019t become clear what they actually mean and how I should react to them. Also, how come I got two speakeasy places with different upgrade levels, but both making the same profit. \n\n5, Make combat meaningful\u2028\nRight now, it feels just like grinding. Too many of them, too similar. Most annoying is when somebody attacks one of your places you don\u2019t care about and you have to defend it in a combat that looks and feels just like the other 10 fights you had before.\n\n6. Bring strategy to combat\u2028\nOnce you enter and attack a place, your team and your enemies are placed quite randomly and mixed together. Taking cover is often useless because everything is so cramped and mixed up that there\u2019s always someone near whose at your flank or back. Then, you start shooting, often missing even though the enemy is like 2 meters right in front of you. It\u2019s just total chaos.\n\n\nThese are just the most disappointing findings after 3 hours of gameplay - likely, there are other aspect that need an overhaul. This went really so wrong - still can't believe it.\n\nAfter all, the mechanics EoS is using are existing ideas that have been established successfully in other games already. There\u2019s no need for innovation. The answers are out there. All that needs to be done is transferring them into a different setting. \n\nGo for it and bring us the game we want.", "timestamp_created": 1607039361, "timestamp_updated": 1607039473, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81556297": {"recommendationid": "81556297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028320809", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 755, "last_played": 1607330224}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been a fan of Paradox' games for years.

I think I'll start from the top and slowly move my way towards the bottom and be ready for plenty of \"however\" or \"but!\"\n\nI really like the games style, music, atmosphere, and the various mob families and I do enjoy how each of them come with their own perks in terms of combat and business wise. However, I do kinda wish they also had some negatives like if you play as the Tong mob family you'll have tougher times making friends with the Italian mob or they might demand higher prices for specific things you wanna trade with them. The gameplay is a mix of X-com and business management, you need to buy/take over buildings and thus establish various rackets from speakeasies to casinos, it's pretty to wrap your brain around it. But! I do wish there was more nitty-gritty to this setup, like say allowing players to pick a branch of how they wanna further progress a specific type of business say turning a simple brothel into a strip joint or maybe a small-time casino into a poker club or betting house, because as it is you are given a progression but it's simple upgrade stuff that you just need the right sum of money for. Now, this game isn't exactly plot-driven, it's more close to Hearts of Iron or Crusader Kings in terms that you pick your starting family, you get a line of quests to do, but also get various side quests and I will say from the 3 families I tried out the main quests do indeed differ, when it comes to sidequests it's kinda wonky I've seen a few different ones but seems some do indeed repeat. \n\nSince the combat is Xcom style, it does present some challenges, I've seen people claim it's too easy and I dunno what I was missing but the more high-level soldiers of rival families can def put the hurt on you, especially since they can hire other \"elite\" mobsters as you can and if you're playing on normal difficulty. But! With that said, the AI does sometimes pull pretty dumb moves by either going into the open or hiding right next to your guy where you can land clean shots on them. Oh, yes, this game has elite mobsters you can hire as you level up your notoriety, however, some mobsters won't work for you if you have a specific guy they dislike on your team and some can build relationships and even open some sidequests for them. Which I must say, adds a nice flavor but you'll probably pick your favorites pretty early. \n\nThere's also various weapons/gear you can obtain by either searching for Big Jim Colosimo crates, during missions or buying from the black market, usually, it's guns (the rarer the weapon the more damage it does), gear, or trinkets that add some bonuses. Now, I did run into some glitches during my playthrough, one was a game-breaking one that happened during me playing for the Tongs for some reason, I couldn't find a way to progress after fighting off the attack on my safe house. I didn't find the mechanic for the market all that hard as well, since it's just about making sure your breweries make the right type of booze and making sure you have upgraded the production and storage capacity but again I do wish it gotten more detailed when it came to working on your various rackets. \n\nNow, would I recommend this game? Mmm...Hard to say, it's not flawless and there are def bugs that need patching up, graphic wise it looked fine and its combat isn't bad but can be given a challenge on a higher difficulty, I like how each family has various abilities and the characters have their own special skills, but kinda wish there was also negative trait aspects that would make you decide how to balance your alliances properly. I do wish the business mechanic allowed for more choices on how to set up the business, I've seen people that we're hoping for Gangsters game, but as I said it feels more like a more compact version of HoF and Crusader Kings since you can even set how many families you wanna face off against. I will say this if you wanna have a Mobster Turn-Based/RPG/Bussiness management type game, give this a shot. If you're hoping for a Gangsters type game? Sorry, this ain't it and I fully admit I want a similar game (for me it would Chicago 1932 Don Capone though), but this game isn't bad. I'd say it's def more fun than Omerta City of Gangsters was, but if you think a price for such a game is too high then grab it on sale and may enjoy yourself and prob have fun trying the various families or seeing if you can beat 'em all or not.", "timestamp_created": 1607038629, "timestamp_updated": 1607038629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.403014302253723145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81555766": {"recommendationid": "81555766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198968014651", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1210, "last_played": 1607029638}, "language": "english", "review": "DogShiet Game", "timestamp_created": 1607038051, "timestamp_updated": 1607422362, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81555642": {"recommendationid": "81555642", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992273586", "num_games_owned": 663, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 500, "last_played": 1607037324}, "language": "english", "review": "It's obvious a lot of love, thought and care went into making this game.\n\nSadly it's just not playing well for me.\n\nOn paper it sounds right up my alley, 20's mobster X-Com, develop your gang, your business, take over the city.\nIn execution I just don't feel the various systems work in unison right now.

The upgrades are so expensive that the AI doesnt seem to take advantage of it. Or if you take over a building its lvl 1, because I have yet to see an upgraded building.  Its better to just go to war, kill the boss and instantly double your holdings without effort. You will balloon fast.\n\nCombat is fine without bugs. Nothing too deep. But the AI will sometimes, even if they could kill a target, walk away and heal. Or run right at you out of cover and heal.  The maps basically force chokepoint killboxes, but the AI will always rush into them. Usually you will have 6 or 7 people die around the same 5 hexes. In six hours I've only lost 2 unnamed guards in 3 wars. No one seems to surprise attack you, but you can usually get a surprise attack off, kill a few guards before the combat even starts. \n\nOh, and if you have allies and cops near by when you ambush someone else your allies and cops will fight. You will have to wait it out, but you get no rep loss for whoever loses. But all their gear.\n\nI feel like the cops are on my side.

Bosses are OP, I played as the Vice Kings boss whose special ability allows him to unload an entire pistol clip into any enemies in range and killed the tutorial boss in 1 turn.

The generation of these fights is tedious at best, you'll be plopped down (probably surrounded) in a construction site with a bunch of thugs who will try to rush you. \n\n\nThere are two resources to manage in Empire of Sin. Money and alcohol. You start out with barely any income in either of these and are expected to expand. In the tutorial you are immediately pushed into the red by hiring 2 underlings, each of which has a minimum wage of $300. You don't need them this early. Paying to upgrade your rackets doesn't pay off nearly as quickly as going around fighting thugs and establishing new ones and you don't need hirelings to do this.\n\nDiplomacy is handled quite poorly. Every time you meet a new gang they will threaten you, and you have the option to threaten, negotiate with, or attack them. If you choose one of the first two then they will invariably demand that you pay them $2000 to avoid a relations penalty, possibly in addition to the penalty from threatening them.\n\nThe voice acting is ok I guess.

I love the representation of real world mobsters, but what I would really love , is the ability to create my own mobster, and have a list of positive traits, or flaws to choose from. I would love to be able to choose the clothing style, and all of the customization that goes into character creation. Introducing these things would be an incredible leap for this game, and really make it something special, in my opinion.

Not engaging, didn't really bother after that.\nPolice - Did nothing. \n\n\"Well this sounds pretty negative\" I hear you say. Possibly. I think those features could add a lot to the game, I also think maybe it's just some balancing issues. I played Goldie and her ability lets you kill a whole raft of enemies in the very first turn.

My best advice is to start a new game with the Lieutenant difficulty (at least). I managed to get a game over screen. So yes, it is possible to have a challenge and to lose.\n- The combat AI can do some weird stuff, but it is ok imho as the numbers of involved gangsters can be huge. More than often you will fight grunts which are weak, but that's how it is meant to be as you are supposed to be able to settle down and get a few businesses. Later fights (in higher difficulty) can prove to be difficult. I lost a game.\n- While the tutorial is well done, there are still things I wish I had known before starting:\n1. You can assign your boss to the safehouse by clicking on a desk in safehouse.\n2. When in another neighborhood it is done automatically when you secure a safehouse.\n3. Use Lieutenant or more as difficulty (I really mean that).\n4. If you want to see what combos and bonuses you get from them, you need to have a hotel and click on it to get taht summary!\n\nPros:\n- The atmosphere is perfect, graphics, animations, sounds. I think there is not been a tactical gangster game that received such a good technical realisation.\n- I think I finally have my gangsters (hothouse) replacement. I mean, like the former, you still need a bit of effort to get into it and not everything will be perfect. I think they really succeeded at giving us more control to what we used to have in gangsters.\n- It is much more dynamic than Gangsters/Omerta.\n- The presentation is really good with many quests on top of the typical activities you expect from the genre.\n- The economy looks balanced to me. In other words, there is some management to be done in this game. Some might complain that it is meaningless as with time you always get money. In Transport Fever also, but there is still management to be done so you can get money faster.\n- The map is really well done and the way you can zoom in/out in details without much interruption is really well done.\n- This is pretty much what I think everybody wants from a gangster game.\n\nCons:\n- A few bugs here and there (animation gets stuck when you deathblow somebody with a knife). The worse one I had was called for a truce, didn't reply, called for a truce myself, concluded it, then went to the 1st meeting game bugged out. But game is very playable nonetheless.\n- Some UI issues. For example, finding and moving gangsters can be difficult at times (unless I missed some important way to do so). For example, if I assigned my boss to safehouse and want him to go for another neighborhood with some other guys, it can be a chore.\n- I find myself a bit confused by some info I don't get, or didn't find yet. I have been involved in proxy wars and didn't know when they started or ended clearly because the game does not tell you this very clearly at times. I think I got involved because I accepted to protect factions (they pay me). If said faction goes to war, I can chose to honor our deal, but the issue sometimes I noticed they went in a truce and me too, and sometimes I had just lost a racket and could not get it back because of truce. Was confusing.\n\nAnd the last thing I want to share is that I think a lot of confusion comes from the fact that the game is in between storytelling, sandbox game and conquest/competitive.\nI personally don't mind it at all. I mean sometimes, I just wanna chill a bit, take my time improving stuff. I think people will have some issues because the mechanics of the game are not always clear cut or as visible as in a XCom game for example, or a Civilization/Age of Wonders.\nWhen I write this I think XCOM chose for a meh map with very clear options to chose in the base. Civ has a very pretty map but no tactical.\nThis game is ambitious because it tries both. But it might be a bit confusing at time, but yet I'm really entertained by it and really liking it.\n\nI think it is a game that should be approached a bit like a crusader kings: you're not necessarily here to conquer the whole  map (well that's the goal of the game alright), but still also a bit to play your own story and see how you're going to achieve that.\nIf you're easily frustrated by the fact that some mechanics are not entirely clear, then this game might not be for you. If you liked the old gangsters, remember it was also a game that could not be fully understood in one playthrough. \nThink also Transport Fever: of course you will get there eventually, the question is also how and how efficiently you will try to do so.\n\nI really like the game and appreciate the obvious effort that has been put into it!", "timestamp_created": 1607026354, "timestamp_updated": 1607026354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54596102237701416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81545640": {"recommendationid": "81545640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000089379", "num_games_owned": 594, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 834, "last_played": 1607368362}, "language": "english", "review": "So empire of sin.

The feedback in store although correct i feel is very angry. I wanted to get in some gameplay before posting a review and i think its best summarised by saying its A Swing and a Miss. For now at least.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really want to enjoy this game (And I Do) But there are a lot of issues that need addressing which judging by the feedback on the store a lot of people have noticed and are angry about. If this was a \u00a320 game then fair enough but paying a lot of money and getting hyped for this has been a bit disappointing seeing the state it is in at launch.  \n\nThat being said, I fully support the developers and wish them the best of luck in resolving these issues, but there is alot for a \u00a370 game on release.\n\nSo to begin:\n\nThe combat is X-com style i guess you could say but lacking the Umph. Ai isnt the brightest and charges straight at you, even if they have good cover. The animations feel clunky at times and if the animation freezes the game pauses for a significant amount of time whilst it catches up with itself (Sometimes resulting in a crash) Also seen issues where the character models stop walking or running, even taking cover correctly. They just start hovering and sliding their way across the screen, when this happens there is a significant wait time for actions to finish before the game carries on. (Like 20 seconds, its really bad xD)\n\nExecutions are cool, however most the time I kill someone who's downed they stand back up before falling back down to their death.  \n\nIf you get into combat and two other factions are fighting, you have to wait for them to resolve their conflict before you can carry on your game. (Very annoying when its 3 thugs and a few police whilst you're just sat there skipping turns waiting to raid the last boss's safehouse.)\n\nThe gangsters you can hire are the same every playthrough, what i mean by this is that because there is a notierety structure for unlocking and recruitment, you get stuck with the same 5 gangster each time you start. Not neccassarily a bad thing, but maybe give an option to randomise it as it becomes very repetitive. Speaking of; the maps are heavily recycled usually featuring the bloodstains of past battles outside of the fighting area but still there even though its your first time there. \n\nMissions are chained and presented to you so fast that you never have time to finish them. Strips away any player autonomy in completing missions. (Reminds me of the Settlement mission questline in fallout 4)\n\nDiplomacy feels like a lost cause as its always better to just kill off the competition and take their rackets. As soon as you conquer their safehouse, all their empire becomes yours. Basically streamlines players to attack safehouse before rackets. If there is a way to finish a game with an alliance i haven't found it yet. \n\nUpgrading of rackets is incredibly costly and time consuming. Usually more cost effective to conquer others or buy new ones.  Also the hotel synergy could do with a bit of elaboration. \n\nThere no customisation either with regard to your gangsters. You can edit their loadout but thats about it. Theres like 5 archetypes Enforcer, Con Artist, Doctor, Hired gun, Demolitionist. No real stand out qualities in any of them besides the obvious (Doctor can heal, Bomb guy has bombs.) But no visual customisation at all.\n\nEven though the city management is good and intuitive, it feels shallow and easily mastered.\n\nA few pros:\n\nVisually stunning,\nUnique storyline for each boss,\nThere is alot to do. (Like any paradox game really)\nThe music is great (There is one song with a very noticable loop though, please fix this, it breaks me everytime. xD)\n\nI want to reiterate however that this game has a lot of potential and its not awful its just buggy as s**t and needs some TLC. \n\nI feel alot of us may have boarded the hype train and its sadly crashed.\nWe wanted an Xcom Omerta but we got a BTEC jagged alliance in a fedora. \n\nSo, maybe wait for a sale to buy the game or buy it and enjoy but expect it to be unpolished and buggy. I don't think its worth \u00a350 to \u00a370 price tag in current state. \n\nIts not the end however, if they fix the issues (and I've seen that their working on patches already) then i'm all for the amount I paid. But please fix the issues. \n\nWe got faith in you Romero. \nDon't let us down.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1607022490, "timestamp_updated": 1607022490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.398207396268844604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81542406": {"recommendationid": "81542406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198228489728", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 850, "last_played": 1608064505}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing, however it still has some bugs that make it a lil unplayable.

My first complaint about the game I don't know whether the tone is supposed to be a joke or more serious. Which sucks because I took this game to be a little more serious than it is...It makes you feel like your more a mob boss in Saints Row than in the Godfather. \n\nI will quickly go through the cons for me personally:\n\n-THE GAME IS SO EASY. You have to play on the hardest difficulty just to get a small push back from the game. And the challenge only comes from boss fights. With in 30 minutes of my first game I was the strongest faction and I didn't even really know what I was doing.\n-If were going to be kinda of historically accurate then why as an Irish Mob boss from the northside do I have asian women in dressed down male suites guarding my rackets...it makes the game feel like even more of a joke. I do like the female bosses and some are based on history which is pretty cool! But I don't remember Al C hiring mostly chinese women to guard his rockets...just saying. \n-All the neighborhoods look the same! I am no expert on what chicago looked like in the 20s, but I would bet that Chinatown and North Chicago didn't look exactly the same!\n-In the first game, I played Dion who historically was the biggest rival for Al C. So why in my safehouse do I have a painting of Al in my office? Oh because all of the safehouses are carbon copies of eachother and I guess they made one for Al and then said fuck it.\n-Ai, Combat, and balance is just broken. \n\nI don't know who I am more disappointed in...myself for getting this game even though I saw the reviews. The Devs and Publisher who thought this was worth $40, or all the youtubers/Twitch streamers who keep saying that this game is sooo good. I only listen two people(s) for reviews...Worth a Buy on youtube, and very small streamers on twitch. Because they are not be paid buy the company to shovel their shit. \n\nAre there any good parts?\n\nYes, but they are overshadowed by all the bad.\n\nDid I have any fun?\n\nYeah, I will admit that I times I was enjoying it, but don't worry it doesn't last for long.\n\nWill I keep playing?\n\nSure. I mean I paid for it. \n\n\nLastly...my message to the Devs....Im not touching your DLC, so go ahead and waste your time making it. \n", "timestamp_created": 1607020472, "timestamp_updated": 1607020472, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 138, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.83772510290145874", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81540852": {"recommendationid": "81540852", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974318172", "num_games_owned": 421, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 958, "last_played": 1607019062}, "language": "english", "review": "Buggy game, but this can be fixed by patches.

That it is not.\nEmpire of Sin is a shallow, buggy, and unchallenging experience that could've been great.\n\nCombat is easy so long as your boss is there as they are utterly overpowered. I played Frankie Donovan and he was never in any danger of dying, one-shotting every other boss with his unique ability; and from what I hear the other bosses are similar in their overpoweredness. Add to that the fact that the AI is the the definition of predictable and you've got yourself brainless, easy combat.\n\nThe management is equally easy, all you really need is aggressive expansion before you're rolling in cash. Breweries supply alcohol, everything other than brothels takes alcohol, no need for upgrades. If you lose a building that's no problem, obliterate your enemy's faction and get it back plus all his other rackets. Build a hotel in each neighbourhood for extra cash, though it's hardly necessary.\n\nDiplomacy is worthless. No matter how much other factions bitch and moan they cannot stop you, and if they declare war they're basically committing suicide and handing you their rackets. It's domino effect, the angrier the other factions get, the quicker you expand, which will anger more factions, which will make you expand quicker and so on.\n\nThen there's the bugs. As I experimented with the game, I saw many of them, from people getting randomly hurt to their animations breaking to parts of the UI disappearing, but I also encountered two game breaking bugs: the classic infinite loading screen and one where one of the enemies was slingshotted of the map before combat began, making it impossible for me to kill him and for combat to end. Lovely.\n\nThe state of this game resembles early access, or even an alpha build.

This game isn't a total mess. I have not encountered any game breaking bugs like so many claim. I haven't even had a crash. Does it need some polishing? Sure! but it's published by paradox and paradox notoriously and historically have shitty launches. This doesn't mean the game is ruined. It's no grand strategy like the ck series but it is a very fun and entertaining sim/strat mob gangster game. Especially compared to some of the other games in this niche genre. I admit, the diplomacy could use some help. I literally take actions for and against my allies and foes with almost no repercussion. Other than sometimes starting mob wars I fell pretty unbothered by most of the gangsters around me, which I don't mind because it allows for a setup to start the empire before taking on other bosses. I think that's the point though. It would be abundantly annoying if every single transgression resulted in an attack. Nothing would get done. I would like to see continuity in diplomacy though. Idk why my nemesis just asked for my protection when I'm definitely trying to murder them. Little things like that I'm not understanding or maybe it is in the system of the actual game, if so they need to define that because it's causing mass confusion, obviously. Maybe he asked for protection because his enemy is more of a threat than I am, but these are things I think should be defined. I would like to see a better UI in the diplomacy screen. Showing business ties and partnerships and enemies alike would be beneficial to have on one page. Even then, you can still find these things if you look under sub-tabs. \n Now, on to the combat. I honestly have not seen what other people are talking about and how the AI is acting in weird ways. I have had challenging encounters where AI are flanking and maneuvering in appropriate fashion, like: taking cover, flanking, throwing explosives, and healing. So again, I don't see where everyone is having \"such a horrible time\" in combat. This isn't xcom and I'm glad it's not. I'm the god damn boss. I should be able to kill 4 lowly thugs and 1 associate by myself if need be. Even then, the associates and made mobsters aren't being killed in a single round by my boss. There is still work to be done in combat in order to win, so I'm not understanding the general consensus that combat is on easy mode. \n Lastly, the economy. I think the economy is astounding in this game. It makes sense. Little to no maintenance in businesses that don't require it, like a brothel. On the opposite end you have to maintain and operate your brewery and speakeasy more frequently. Again, I don't understand why people are complaining the economy makes no sense or is on easy mode like the combat. You have to have consistency and rules in a video games economy. Through and through I see this consistency. The game tells you the pros and cons of opening certain rackets and they do exactly as it says. I think it makes sense to have more brothels in the roaring 20's of Chicago followed by a few speakeasies. These are the rackets you'll most likely have an abundance of and for good reason. If you have an abundance of these and you get raided by the police you don't lose every chance of having all your profits for the week vanish from you and ending your reign. If it were like that I'm sure people would be even more upset. I just think people haven't been taking over or been being taken enough to see why the economy runs the way it does. \n I'd like to finish by saying I am enjoying this game very much. Although, I have noticed a few queer occurrences. The mouth movement is way tf off. It's off putting to see how some of their mouths move in dialogue scenes. lmao. Also, for about 4 hours yesterday my enforcer was stuck in an attack position, he just had his arms up like he was brandishing a shotgun. Did not affect the game or gameplay. He is back to normal now. Lastly, I had a weird bug, if it is one, where after deciding to open a new safehouse in a new neighborhood then deciding I didn't want to once I got to the lieutenant decision screen the game left me in the derelict building and reset the encounter once I walked outside. Not a huge deal, but it would be annoying in a harder situation. I think they should give the option to walk away from whatever building you just cleared and have a small window to decide on your actions for that building, rather than immediately making you decide.\n Finally, I think adding a glossary would help polish this bad boy up.

They do help you play to a certain play style however which kind of makes it similar to XCOM but very poorly similar since you have to wait a stupid amount of days to make one of your characters have a certain ability instead of it going of experience per say, but I feel that might be because you don't really have counters to certain enemy types because they all pretty much act the same, melee characters are the only ones that have a unique way of attacking you which is pretty much just sprint at you and try and do damage. \n\nThe combat seems to be something that is getting a lot of hate to be fair, but honestly? It really isn't that bad, It got a little more difficult for me when I was fighting my second mob boss just because their businesses were more upgraded compared to the previous mob boss I took over, but you can just hire another mobster to make it easy again really, the real challenge comes from attacking safehouses, like attacking and taking over places is usually easy as anything, but safehouses actually put you against mobsters with high health meaning you have to play strategically, but that really just means using full cover more so your squad don't take loads of hits, as for people saying\"the enemies just run in.\" well, the THUGS DO, THE ACTUAL GANGSTERS YOU FIGHT LATER ON IN THE GAME DON'T. \n\nThe world is incredibly dry, you go to point A, quest progressed! Then go to point B, read some absolutely pointless dialogue, IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU GET TO HEAR SOME POOR VOICE ACTING! But thats pretty much every side quest.. The diplomacy is quite frankly absolute garbage compared to any other paradox game, I shouldn't really compare but when they said that diplomacy would play a big factor in this game, well they lied, non-aggression okay fair enough it makes sense for later on when other factions have more then one district but early on its just a pointless mechanic, you can make a business agreements but you honestly could just rush the starting district and basically get the same benefits, you can ask for money, and booze, you can sell booze, and the war mechanic is incredibly basic, like why in the world would you make a mob game where you can't just straight up blow up a business to start said war, why do I have to go into the diplomacy tab and select \"start war\" like no, even the old godfather games on ps2 had more depth to them in this regard, there is other options sure but they really aren't even worth going into because they're quite frankly disappointing in comparison to other games with diplomacy, why is there no option to rob stores and banks? I do reckon they will become more fleshed out as months go by but it should be done from day one.\n\nBusiness types are pretty boring; casinos which is RNG cash, brothels which is just a set amount of cash, brewerys (tbf i do like the idea of choosing which alcohol you want to make because MANAGEMENT), but they produce alcohol, speakeasys again, set amount of cash depending on which alcohol type is being sold, and then a hotel which increases customers but you can only build one in each district. Its actually baffling why they didn't add businesses like loan sharks, protection rackets, ponzi schemes, chopshops, and gun/weapon racketing, sure its the prohibition era but really!? These type of businesses played a big role as well.\n\nThe only bug I've come across is one of my mobsters literally taking 10-15 secs to fire their gun which would take like 1 second with any other of my mobsters i use, it ain't that annoying but you can't help but think HAS THE GAME CRASHED?!?! but no it hasn't its just you have to wait 15 secs for this stupid mobster to fire his damn weapon off every single damn time its his go and you make him target someone.\n\nTo be honest, its not awful but its not a gem like major reviewers made it out to be, I'm enjoying it at the minute, but after about 5 hours i felt like I'd pretty much done everything already. I really think in a few to several months time that the game will be either decent, good or amazing, but until then, just wait until they add more to it because its honestly not worth the \u00a334.99 price tag, its basically a \u00a320 game at its current state.", "timestamp_created": 1607012969, "timestamp_updated": 1607040522, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81534274": {"recommendationid": "81534274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198971625939", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 461, "last_played": 1607179896}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun, has an x-com style combat system, the dialogue is great even if the talking animations are a bit off.

The main game layer is set up more like a RTS game with a bunch of AI empires on the map all expanding and fighting each other at the same time in real time, with some basic diplomacy options. You capture a limited set of basic building types that all boil down to extra money per week, and each building has a few tiered upgrades that make them better at making you money or better at defending themselves. To take over another empire on the map all you have to do is attack their safehouse and fight their boss, which is an easy battle, then all of their buildings are transferred to you. That is pretty much the extent of that gameplay layer. There is no research or special empire upgrades, it's just buildings that make money so you can get more buildings to make money, money that doesn't really matter because you can just take your starting 3 characters and wipe out everyone on the map right off the bat.\n\nThere are other layers to the game though. The combat layer is pretty simplistic and needs a lot of balancing, but has room to maybe be more interesting in the future as there's a random gear system and some RPG-like progression. It's turn based xcom style with cover and overwatch, with a number of special abilities than can be quite powerful for your units to learn. You can just go around picking fights all you want for loot and money rewards, with a shop to buy a random selection of equipment.\n\nAnother layer is the quest system, each leader and each NPC you hire has a number of personal quests that pop up, in addition to a large number of generic quests that take place around the map, many of these have multiple ways to finish them based on your character's stats or your own preference. For example you can pay a guy off to leave you alone or just kill him, if you kill him you might in the future have to deal with his buddies trying to get revenge, things like that. This is probably the most interesting game layer currently, but other than interesting stories and some pieces of loot, you don't get much out of it other than more money.\n\nGraphics are passable, but not amazing. Animations are very janky at times with arms bending in ways they should never bend as a unit moves around, or bullets firing sideways out of a gun as the person firing it stops the animation too early. The UI could use some work, for example the overworld command menu is a pie menu but doesn't trigger based on what is highlighted only what is clicked, so you see an option highlighted and you click thinking you selected that option, but you didn't because you click just outside the menu and closed it instead.\n\nIf you treat this game as a serious strategy or management game, you will probably be a bit disappointed. If you play it as more of a sandboxy RPG there's a decent offering. Like don't try to win right away, just run around doing quests, killing enemies, and hiring new crew, it's an alright time waster. If you are trying to win, you could probably finish a \"match\" in like an hour or two, you basically just have 20 or so easy fights to win, which would be pretty boring obviously.\n\nI don't usually give scores, but this game is kind of borderline so I want to explain my thumbs up. I would personally rate this game at like a 60-65%, given the $40 price and current state of things. There are better uses for your money, but it's not an awful game. If you really enjoy the mobster theme (I think it's cool but I'm not a true \"fan\") this might be more like a 70-80% for you.

I enjoy the setting, and I like the XCOM like aspect of combat (albeit not very difficult in most cases).  If you want to play a game where you play the role of a feared mob boss with little that can stand in your way, you\u2019ll get some enjoyment out of this.  If you\u2019re looking for a challenge, keep walking.\n\nMany of the other reviews have covered some of the flaws, and I won\u2019t restate them.\n\nBut a major flaw I\u2019ve found is how battle in the street works.  When battle begins in a building, it\u2019s clear, attackers vs. defenders.  However, some battles will take place in the streets. For example, if you are going to attack a racket, you have to first take out the guards posted outside, so there is no avoiding it.  \n\nWhen an outdoor battle initiates, it carves out a section of the neighborhood map as the battle area. Any non civilian character that happens to be in that area is part of the fight.  This can include your gangsters, gang guards guarding close by buildings (these can be friendly, enemy or neutral), police that happen to be patrolling the area, down to some random thug in the alley with no gang affiliation that feels it\u2019s necessary to jump in the fight rather than mind his own business. On paper this sounds kinda cool, but here are some issues I ran into:\n\nIn the game sometimes you have a nonaggression pact with specific gangs.  This can happen after you\u2019ve been at war with them, and decide to form a truce.  This means that your standing with the gang is still \u201cenemy\u201d, but you just have agreed not to fight each other for some time.  If you break this pact you take a hit to your honor.  So if you\u2019re attacking a different gang in the street, and there happens to be some guards from the gang you have the pact with, guess what, they join the fight and start shooting at you (since they are your enemy). If you defend yourself this BREAKS THE PACT!!!\n\nAnother bad situation I got into, I was attacking one gang, and two other gangs that were neutral to me but at war with each other were also on the map.  This triggered a fight among just them, and I had to sit and watch the dumb AI guards battle it out, skipping the turns for each of my gangsters over and over until finally one side won.\n\nAnother great situation, I was being attacked and controlling a single guard outside a racket being attacked by 3 enemy guards.  All I did was get shot and run to cover near a police officer that happened to be nearby (I was hoping he would help protect me, since I was outnumbered).  The police officer got shot by the enemy attackers, and when it became his turn, HE ARRESTED ME!\n\nTl;dr: Fun game if you like the idea of XCOM in a 1920\u2019s setting, and aren\u2019t looking for a challenge.

In my attempted playthrough i immediately went for Frankie the Irish booze loving ruffian.\n\nHow the game unfolds:\nYou build your empire by Taking over \"Rackets\" from thugs where you then spend money changing the racket into the type you want. alternately you can take rackets from rival mobster factions. You then upgrade the rackets in various points trying to gain more money so you can hire more henchmen. then  go to war, trade or ally with other mobsters as you try to become king of Chicago. \n\nPros:\n-Really good concept and very stylish. \n\n-Great well rounded characters. I especially the different personalities of the different Bosses. \n\n-World is way bigger than you first realize\n\n-Love the perk system even if its basically ripped from games like XCOM.\nCombat is feels pretty neat tho the AI could use some polish. There are plenty of perks, items and classes you can go choose between.\n\n-I personally absolutely love the atmosphere of the game.\n\n-The trade system works well. If a faction boss has a low opinion you will have to give him more for his items and you get less money for yours in return. (tho this means trading with people who likes you is extremely broken because you can just sell all your stuff to them when ever they have a lot of money)\n\nCons:\n\n-The game feels very repetitive. I struggled a lot with money and income in general. Granted i might just be incompetent at the game. I spent a lot of time looting thug rackets just to gain items that i could sell so i could upgrade my rackets. it never seemed to give a big difference. \n\n-There are a few game breaking glitches. I have had the game freeze on me. Been unable to move characters, Have quest characters disappear  from the place i am supposed to meet them. Seems like a few bugs to many after only 8 hours of playtime.\n\n-The game progress slowly. You have a lot of time thinking \"what should i do now?\" With no sense about the timing regarding payday from your rackets. A speed up button would have been nice or a clear timer for when you receive income.\n\n-The game has a raiding system. I am not sure how this works. I believe its when the police shows up at your rackets. You can spend money on rackets that decrease the effect of a raid, but i never saw any notification or consequence  that a raid had been preformed.\n\nAll in all several stats seem unclear of whtat they do exactly \n\nOther minor things:\n\n- Lack of interactions with other crime bosses. I love the \"sit downs\" but feel like they could be more and that a sit down also would take place for things like trade, war invitations and maybe even in the favor system? \n\n- The ambush mechanic is confusing and seems unreliable.\n\n- The ability to customize would be swell. definitely not a must but more like the icing on the cake. Simply to have a greater feel that it is \"your\" empire. \n\nRecomandation:\n\nI will recommend the game simply because i can't deny i had a blast in the 8 hours. I will definitely try to complete the game and become king of Chicago but i fear that the game will drag out and become more like a chore then a fun experience. Hopefully the game can be updated a bit because this game really could become my favorite game.\n\nnot a 10/10 but it could be with updates and time", "timestamp_created": 1607005691, "timestamp_updated": 1607182830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81527590": {"recommendationid": "81527590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262159336", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 980, "last_played": 1607259133}, "language": "english", "review": "buggy", "timestamp_created": 1607005322, "timestamp_updated": 1607005322, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81527276": {"recommendationid": "81527276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008559465", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 551, "last_played": 1606960771}, "language": "english", "review": "As much as I wanted to like this game, I just couldn't. The developers certainly went for breadth over depth with this and fell far short of what's advertised.

You basically spend hours fighting the same enemies with the same 3-4 people to establish the same fronts (casino, speakeasy, brothel, brewery, and a hotel that doesn't seem to do much). On top of this, the game has a lot of bugs as of its release. The AI in both strategic and tactical settings is awful. While the cut-scenes and interactive dialogue seems really engaging the first play-through, this too gets really repetitive when you come to realize that different heads of different gangs basically just repeat each other's lines for a given situation (sit-downs, mostly).

However in the current state I couldn't recommend it to my friends and here's why: \n\nFirst ill start with the things they can change:\n\nI'm going to give them a bit of a grace period to fix these problems but BUGS are a MAJOR problem in this game and it really hinders on the experience and I would have much prefer the game being stalled release instead of being released with these bugs.\n\n1. One of the biggest and most annoying bugs for me is I was playing one of the bosses named \"Mabel\" and in her storyline/main quests called \"Back in the fold\" where you have to talk to Sal (which is the cab driver introduced in the prologue) He moves to a location inbetween the neighbourhoods where your gang can't reach, So youre just stuck going that far in the game because yknow, you can't continue the story! Which really bummed me out.\n\n2. The combat is BUGGY. I love this type of combat with the turn based and what not. But their has been countless times where my character has just frozen. and sat still for like 20 seconds before any actions go off. May not be a big bug but it gets progressively more annoying the more it happens. Especially when you cant alt tab this game so well, you just gotta stare at a frozen screen for a while before everything catches up. (I also think i figured out swapping your guns does fix this but it shouldn't be in the game regardless) \n\nEdit: ive discovered another bug with the game, when in it seems to be killing the bosses in the safehouse or trying too the game just stops and is frozen permanently.. really frustrating experience with that. \n\nNow some of the problems that I have with the game, Stuff I think they'll have no intent in changing.\n\n1. The interactions between other factions, to put it simply, clunky and restrictive. Whenever you sit down with the other leaders it all feels so static, their mouths move like robots and their emotions don't always represent what they're saying, I just find the entire experience very, restricting. I like more decisions that could be made too.\n\n2, The Ui is well, kinda clunky. maybe I havent gotten my mind around it yet but its kindof an overload. \n\n3. In combat the animations are really slow. It reaaaallly drags out the battles with how slow they all move, and how they have to move to a position, then readjust before the next person does anything. I feel like a speed up in the tempo in how they do stuff, especially the executes could really make the game more thrilling to play. Also if they get shot twice in quick concession (like with the pistols) hit or miss. They get locked in their animations of the first shot so the second one is always very.. lagged and behind. out of place and all because they just react a lot later than they should be.\n\nMaybe i'm just nitpicking here but this is just my opinion on the game and I don't normally do reviews, I just have a lot of passion for this genre and hope the best for this game.

I like the strategy layer because, much like Godfather: Blackhand Edition, it feels compelling to build out your empire starting with throwing people through windows, and later through diplomacy, threats of violence and real violence.

There's so much more to it as well.\n\nCertain neighborhoods have certain alcohol types they prefer, which can change, so you have to be mindful of what you're producing and where you're producing it. Keeping your gangsters in certain establishments run the risk of various different negative traits as well. Don't stay in a brothel too long or else you might snatch up an STD! Stuff like this really makes you give things a second look, and with how extensive the Empire Management screen is, you can see they definitely wanted to double down on the strategy aspect of things.\n\nBut unfortunately, nothing meaningful ever really comes of it in any impactful way(s). At most it's usually an extra couple $$$ if you play your cards right, and honestly I never had someone pick up any negative trait by staying too long in any one place.\n\nThere's a certain level of interest in the RPG-lite type mechanics in place, where you roll persuade checks, and despite appearances there's some decision making in dialogue to be made, so I definitely give credit to the game here. One intriguing part of the game is that each mobster you potentially hire seems to have their own backstory and side quests. One gentlemen I hired named Grover had a backstory in the circus of all things. His side quest involved me going to one of my owned establishments and either talking to the person who potentially betrayed him or just letting him kill him outright. I talked to him personally with my boss and found out it was a misunderstanding and Grover was mistaken. It isn't huge, but it serves to give the game some life and personality.\n\nDespite this though, the biggest shortcoming is definitely the combat. While if you've played Firaxis' XCOM games, you will be completely familiar with the formula, though it's such an unbalanced mess here. Sniper rifles are so grossly overpowered that it's such a no brainer to just equip anyone you can with them. Shotguns underperform, SMGs and LMGs confer aim(marksmanship) penalties, and pistols don't do nearly enough damage to warrant using them in any meaningful manner. I actually don't think I bothered to use my pistols once outside of being forced when I don't have access to a main weapon. \n\nThe Heal skill is only on a 1 turn cooldown, heals a good chunk, and it feels like all level 1 security for your establishments get it. It also only takes 1 action point to use so you can often cheese out fights with it, because another failing of the game is the atrocious AI. They will often just stand in the open or take bad angles to take pot shots at you. It isn't like it's much better for you, because your security have such awful aim, that even with a proper flank and ideal range you're getting like 55% to hit at most. Most defense missions are just boring dice rolls where the AI doesn't do itself any favors. \n\nAs an aside really quickly, what I find odd is that the game even tells you your percentage chance to win or lose a defense mission but offers no way to autoresolve. Lol? I feel like that is either a mechanic that didn't make it in, got scrapped, or is coming.\n\nYour generic goons are whatever. Bosses? They can solo entire rooms full of people, and some of their abilities are just GROSS with how powerful they are. Daniel Mckee Jackson gets an ability called Last Rites which is essentially Face Off from XCOM where he keeps shooting his pistol. But for some reason it does MORE damage than his pistol, and doesn't seem to give a FUCK about his magazine capacity. I had a 6 shooter but dude shot 8 times and killed 4 people. Balance in this game is nutty and trivializes so much of the combat encounters. Again Sniper Rifles being broken always keeps popping up in my mind, as at one point I had a boss vs. boss battle and I legit crit him from the other end of the room and one shot him.\n\nGiven that this is a Paradox published game with an \"expansion\" or season pass, I would hope and think that patches are going to happen. So I fully expect them to fine tune some of this stuff. I'd wait until then tbh.

You can only have breweries, distilleries, brothels, casinos and hotels; it'd be nice to see other kinds of businesses.

I really [i]wanted[/i] to enjoy this game.   I really [i]wanted[/i] to love this game.   I really [i]wanted[/i] to recommend this game.   Sadly, I can't really suggest this game for the vast majority of people.\n\nThe game plays very much like Omerta: City of Gangsters.    You're a 1920s era gangster trying to make a name for yourself during prohibition by setting up distilleries, speakeasies, brothels, and casinos.   Along the way you build up your gang which you use to take over neighborhoods of Chicago.\n\nThe combat is a tactical style combat, similar to XCOM or Mutant Year Zero : Road to Eden.   \n\nYou can't create your own gangster, but you can choose from a variety of historical gangsters of the era, as well as some unique ones included to add more variety and diversity to the roster.   Each of these is voice acted and they all have their own unique stories.  The voice acting isn't horrible, but it's not academy award material either, to be honest.   \n\nThe biggest problem is that the game gets very repetitive, very quickly.   Wandering around town, you will get called to sitdowns by the other bosses, one by one.    Should you agree, the conversations are all essentially identical, a fact which is obvious very early on.\n\nThe combat, which can occur on the streets of Chicago or within building maps is as repetitive as the conversations.   This greatly reduces the amount of time the game is enjoyable.   \n\nThere is only one way to win the game--to take over the entire city of Chicago, one neighborhood at a time.  There is only one path to doing this--eliminating other gangs, one gang at a time.   Yes, there are diplomacy options in the game, and you can make deals, including non-aggression pacts or teaming up to take down another gang.   Ultimately though, this can't be used as a strategy to win the game.  Sooner or later, you wll have to take down all of the gangs or you can never win the game.    In the words of Connor MacCleod, \"There can be only one!\"\n\nIn the end, I am disappointed to say that I can not recommend this game for purchase unless you are huge fan of Omerta-City of Gangsters and wish some of the issues in that game like the overpowered enemies were fixed.     Even then, I can't see it being worth the cost giving the extremely limited scope of the game and limited replayability.    I would highly recommend waiting for a deep cut sale price if you purchase it at all.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1606990642, "timestamp_updated": 1606990642, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546695291996002197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81516372": {"recommendationid": "81516372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007262863", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 729, "last_played": 1606989124}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a buggy mess, and even when it's not broken, it's poorly designed.

Many things don't have hotkeys that should (i..e. pause/play button) or the hotkeys aren't listed(e.g. characters' action bars).  This results in a lot more clicking than should be necessary.\n\nThe game is exploitable by using the \"travel to\" function; it instantly teleports you to wherever you want to go.  No travel time needed.  The ideal way to play is basically to pause time, teleport to a building, fight, rinse and repeat.  A few hours of that will get you through the early game to the point where you can sit back and invest in your buildings, but even then, any time spent with the clock running is almost wasted because of how lucrative combat is.\n\nIt feels like the designers never playtested it, or maybe it was rushed to release and it will be fixed in the future.

Dont get the 24 min fool you I played it directly on Paradox Launcher and the time does not transfer over.\n\n\n1. This Game is far away from being finished. I would accept it like this in Early Access but full release? hmmm nope. The Gang introductions are horrible!

The combat is fair, very X-Com Style and there are a lot of details. you can see who carries a medic bag around the waste for Eg. quiet detailed.  However the bosses are Overpowered! why even bother hiring a crew :D they can solo kill everyone except boss fights, but hey you take already all their empire so who cares about the Safe house...\n\n3. The Economy system. Produce Alcohol sell it in a Speakeasy, maybe upgrade it to make your Disctrict happier but really not necessary, brothels and casinos.... Sometimes you win big or lose all luck, fair enough thats a Casino. but there are so many details in the charts which are just one click of a bottom to produce or change or upgrade to get there. \n\n4, There is absolutely no Love put into this game! I mean I watched the Producers playing this and even they found errors and are like well thats ok and hell no they were not fixed. the Dialogs are horrible and not even emotional. how would you let something like this produced? Someone got killed or the finger cut off in the middle of the street, and you dont even notice it and the citizens around you dont even care :D and the Dialogs on that scene no comment.\n\n5. The Fame points, they make no sense to get Noted. I can hire more gangs and when I hit a specific number an Event pops up. so they just show me how far I got into the game but it doesnt matter what I do I still get the points. Not a difference if I safe a life or take one. still same outcome. My boss is honest but hey who cares if I lie to someone no penalty. \n\n6. Loyalty: as soon as you kill a Boss you take over all their Empire, its not like someone actually liked the boss and be hey I dont accept new Ownership! all the Speakeasies brothers and casinos are like Ok no worries, here is the daily money. :D \n\n7. Gang Members, their Stats are not even fitting their role sometimes and as well you can equipt them with  a gun armor and extras  but thats about it. they dont really defer from each other except by picture. you dont build a connection with them, since there is nothing connecting you to them. Well a story to save a wife and to kill and then when you safe their ..... they wont even join and still want money from you :D so hey saving your life is not enough? \n\nI can continue with a list, but I am very disappointed with this result.

Yes the enemy sends out parties of generic mooks to attack you but they're always easy, and you also can see where they want to attack.\n\nOn the defense the rival AI is also atrocious.  I've never seen them upgrade their business' security - which means all fights when taking over a rival's businesses are just too easy.\n\nVoice acting is good.  \nMusic is nice some times  but often repetitive.  Like at your own HQ I think it's on a 30 second loop.\nAnimations are often broken but the ragdolling/machinegun dancing is fun\nFor some reason the game bombards you with quests but they aren't very interesting or they lock you into long conversations (which in game time last days) when you are probably needed elsewhere.\n\nMultiplayer of this would be hilarious.

Empire of sin has no element of discovery at all, you might say that discovering new enemy boss might be relevant to this point but there are no depth to communicate or encountering them.\n\n2) sense of progressing. xcom has a few ways such as research technology, developing mothership, acquiring the ability and resource to manufacture gears for your soliders. Empire of sin lacks all of these element but soldier leveling, which is also done in a very shallow way. very limited number of skills and lacking control of basic attributes when trying to upgrade.\n\n3) x-com provide very good introduction, encounter and climax battle with the few bosses from the war of the chosen. it cannot battle the fun from the nemesis system in shadow of war but is well designed. Empire of sin has none of it. the other bosses are just there for you to kill, they have no personality and no reaction to what you do except increase or decrease your rating. it is a very important missing part as it gives no motivation for the player to level/gear up to battle them and see what will happen.\n\n4) map design. x-com gives you not large, but ample space to construct your formation in each encounter. empire of sin gives you little variation in encounter terrain especially indoor battles which is 90% of battle that you will find yourself in. hugh casino with dozens of enemies and you are stuck in the entrance with no cover. a big minus for me is that empire of sin has no destructable terrain, which makes the game even more boring.\n\nother things such as stupid encounter barrier which makes you wait for enemies 20 turn of movement away to charge at you, bugged quest prevent you to progress such as the third poll cannot be selected when bill asked you to blow it up and jacque's hooker friend doesnt follow you or escape by herself when the quest ask you to help her. or stupid UI that jumps around and make you wait and press multiple button to get to basic element such as switching from upgrading your facilities to changing production of different alcohol.\n\nSeriously, nowadays i get the feeling that the developers themselves dont even try their own games because these problems are so obvious and impossible to miss.\n\ni dont want to wait for 3 years of dlc for this game to be playable, i am fine with the idea of dlc but not fine with waiting so long. i hope they didnt design this shallow game so that it can be port to mobile.\nseriously, i dont care this game is cheap or not, i would rather play a 70usd good game than some 20usd trash", "timestamp_created": 1606986876, "timestamp_updated": 1606986876, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925341129302979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81513815": {"recommendationid": "81513815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097092121", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 957, "last_played": 1607603721}, "language": "english", "review": "the game is good, but it has TONS OF BUGS, mission bugs where my brewery closed permanently due to \"one for me brew for you mission\" even tho i passed 1 year in game after the mission ended? my boss and 1 other crew suddenly missing from my group and the world, no icon or anything, just gone, tried to find them on other neighbor, press B to focus on Boss, but still nothing, and i cant make progress without the boss so i need to start a new game. game breaking bugs makes this game fails. too bad i've been waiting for the game, and yet, another buggy game, worst one i've ever played besides fallout 76. disappointed", "timestamp_created": 1606986583, "timestamp_updated": 1606986583, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505617976188659668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81513410": {"recommendationid": "81513410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001874160", "num_games_owned": 945, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 173, "last_played": 1606961062}, "language": "english", "review": "Haven't really hit any bugs as far I know.

Wait for patches [/h1]\n[u] Animation  [/u]\nThe \"facial animation\" is incredible jittery and is basically just a mouth opening and closing, for example if you open the steam overlay while a scene is playing it pauses, yet the lips keep moving. \nThe animations overall are poor, they often look clunky and out of place, during a sitdown for example you'll loop an animation of the characters looking around, rather than just... interacting. \nCombat animations are just as bad and feel lackluster without any real response, sometimes the 1st phase of an attack such as the crowbar animation won't even play making the attack just feel off. Nothing has weight.\n\n[u] Sound  [/u]\nSound is pretty ok in relation to the quality of the music, the weapons are not terrible but nothing to compliment they could be meatier. \nVoice acting feels really hit or miss, the quality of the audio is pretty decent but they lack variety in what people actually say.. every generic guard just basically says either \"Asshole\" or \"Assholes\". Capone just says \"DONT FORGET IT\" constantly.\nAlso there is ONLY voice acting in cut scenes and sit downs, the rest is text reading which I didn't expect considering the lengthy introductions are all voiced.\n\n[u] Feel/Look [/u]\nNo customisation of your gang at all, every single henchman looks identical, they have about 4 scanned people (at least it looks scanned, and not in a good way) The gangs don't feel unique, the Irish and Italians dress the exact same. Everyone does, every building that has thugs, has 1-2 unit differences which is literally do you have suspenders or not. Otherwise it's infested with what i've been calling Terry the Thug he is by far the most extensive unit in the game.\n\nThe AI is pretty bad as well, i've won almost every single battle and most of those in a single turn because there is no balance in this game, it's very very easy. I'll have to try the hardest soon and see if that does anything but buff their damage. The Ai will also freeze at times and you'll have about 30 people just standing there, luckily this is fixed by a few reloads but .. why doesn't it work?\n\nIf you go to war with someone, they'll send tens of goons to each of your establishments in the blink of an eye, tho you only have your core gangsters as far as i can tell so far.

The aesthetic, music is nice, and the gameplay is xcom tactics/ basic management. The characters are colorful and unique, and its not a bad game if you are in the mood for some casual tactical strategy with a cool 1920s gangster aesthetic and a rudimentary strategic layer. \n\nDon't expect a deep experience or much replayability at this point - each starting character has a set of unique missions, but the gameplay loop is fundamentally the same. The basic idea is that you complete x-com-lite tactical battles to take over bars, brothels, and casinos and expand your empire while defending from AI attacks and doing basic diplomacy, and completing various battle and fetch missions. You control a squad of gangsters that each have unique traits and backstories and fall into one of a few classes with skill trees - doctors, gunmen, brawlers, etc. The tactical battles can be pretty difficult on higher levels, and you face off against both nameless AI goons and the AIs own unique squads of gangsters. You can upgrade your businesses in a few ways but it feels pretty meaningless currently. \n\nSome of the design choices (or choice of what mechanics to forego at release) are pretty frustrating. For example, you can recruit unique characters, but the bulk of your & the AI's forces are nameless goons. When the AI attacks your businesses, you may have one unique character defending, but it is usually a nameless goon vs. nameless goon slugfest where the goons all have a 50% chance at best of hitting each other and it takes two or three shots at least to kill a goon. Its simply boring - and there is no autoresolve, no way to speed up the fights, nor even an option to forfeit the battle, which I would gladly do since when you ultimately win a gang war by killing the opposing gang boss, you get all your businesses back anyways. A way to skip or decline minor, repetitive fights is something I would expect from any modern strategy release, and its absence here suggests that the game was shipped before it was ready.\n\nMore evidence of premature release is that it is currently obviously unbalanced and full of game-breaking bugs. I've had saves corrupted and multiple freezes requiring restart. Some quests are just broken. There are the seeds of an excellent character-driven gangster sandbox strategy game here - maybe they will bloom in time, but its uncertain. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1606977488, "timestamp_updated": 1606977488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81507280": {"recommendationid": "81507280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007237432", "num_games_owned": 521, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 503, "last_played": 1606910737}, "language": "english", "review": "The breadth of an ocean with the depth of a puddle\n\nThis is my first review I've played some bad games but this is the first that's truly disappointed me because of how great it could have been with a little bit more development as the fundamentals are right there's just not enough depth to the systems.\n\nI really wanted to like this game and for the first 2 hours, I was enthralled it's only after that first few hours you see just how shallow this game is. You see the world map it's vast and the variety of gangsters with different personalities then you realize all of this detail doesn't matter as the core gameplay loop is uninspired, repetitive and most of the elements that make it up don't really matter or require your attention.\n\nFirstly combat, combat I found super fun for the first few hours running around with my gang one got killed ow no what do I do now but after a couple of hours you see this is no X-com the combat ai is weak, enemies make stupid mistakes such as standing in the open or not shooting the nearly dead character and now my boss has leveled up a few times I can take him in and nearly destroy an enemy boss's HQ with just him so strong start weak finish to the combat.\n\nEconomy well here the shallowness really shows its self, The economy, in essence, is 1)build brewery 2) build speak easy 3) weave in the occasional hotel and you're done. Upgrades while they can earn you money there's no need to focus on them as once you take over a territory or two your rolling in the cash. This could have been so much more and fed into so many other elements such as combat and storytelling. In this period of time maybe the police take your booze at the docs or on the road, you need to get over there kill them find a truck and get it back or you loose cash for the month, in doing this maybe the police start to hate you more and conduct more raids so you're forced to up your rackets security to survive, maybe you find out an Allie just went through the same and now you can sell them your excess booze for a massive profit.\n\nThe war system, overall just makes the game a bore why do anything except go in and kill other gang bosses so you can take over all the rackets for free.\n\nEnvironments for combat, hell these are repetitive when you kill 3 crime bosses in a row and get the same map every time yeh somethings wrong especially as these guys are supposed to be \"Elite\" bosses, you'd have thought they'd have an environment to suit their character and a couple of nice set pieces at least it really takes away from the work they have put in to make each boss fairly unique in personality.\n\nThe Ai, god its awful in a game like this the AI should be doing the same stuff as you not essentially using cheat codes to build like some 90's RTS (Empire earth loved it but the AI haha) but they dont, they dont build a gang, they dont roam the map fighting wars, they just randomly gain stuff every now and then.\n\nThis game had a ton of potential and feels like it was rushed out the door feature-poor, another year of systems design focusing on the economy, types of rackets, and random events and I think it could have been so much more. Overall a massive disappointment. \n\nIn closing, if this had been an early access release id have been 100% happy but there's just not enough to it to be a retail game that is talking about season passes and DLC. Make sure your base has enough depth and content before you do DLC, otherwise your just charging people to fix something you didn't get right. DLC should be value-adding to an already valuable product not doing stuff that should have been core.\n\n\"Updated as I was wrong on the expansion date, the filler date is 2022,  its not a launch date and it didn't say 2020 I misread, will leave my mistake below still to be transparent about it\"\n\nAs a note just seen there first \"Expansion pack\" releases Jan 1 so they have probably had that in production for 6 months which explains the shalowness \"Please make our game meaningful and deep by buying more stuff from us one day it will be what it should have been\"\n\nI was hoping for mobster x-com instead I got a early accsess beta of it that ill be expected to pay for to turn it in to x-com if it will ever get there.", "timestamp_created": 1606975415, "timestamp_updated": 1607156618, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.727443456649780273", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81507097": {"recommendationid": "81507097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003438535", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 6896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 250, "last_played": 1616468668}, "language": "english", "review": "Running out of beer simulator.", "timestamp_created": 1606975052, "timestamp_updated": 1606975052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81506784": {"recommendationid": "81506784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868274014", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1120, "last_played": 1607054243}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is super addictive.

The dialogue system is irrelevant since no matter your choice of response: it all leads to the same outcome!\n- AI improvement: they keep running out of cover while I'm shooting at them with a freaking machine gun.\n- Characters start battles in odd locations of the map: if they're entering places they should start by the door!\n\n...

A great concept with nice graphics that suffers from what feels like a rushed release. Each boss feels different and the blend of turn based strategy with management is satisfying. However there are many glaring issues that will be listed and will hopefully be fixed. I unfortunately spent 70 dollars on this but I will not refund to support Romero games. Hopefully the dlc will fix the issues.\n\n- Glitches are pretty common. I killed an enemy boss that declared war on me and pulled in two other gangs against me. When I tried to make a truce, The sit down required that I talk to the dead boss. So all I could was walk into the building and do nothing. Another glitch that stagnated my mission progress required me to talk to a guard from a different gang. Too bad a completely different gang came in and murdered him so the quest marker was over a dead body. The only way to fix it was to take the place over and piss someone off.\n\n-Upgrades are way too expensive and take too long to finish. It's more beneficial to just exterminate the competition and take over all their territory when you murder their boss.\n\n- Enemy building types are not invisible to you. The first sit down also reveals the rival gang's safe house since it's hosted there for some reason. Guess who murdered the rival boss right after meeting them? Too weak to take them on immediately? That's okay cause you can fast travel to that rival gang's safe house at any point in the game and murder them. There's no hierarchy system so once that boss is gone that gang is done and all their stuff goes to you.\n\n- The enemy AI is pretty bad. Like throwing grenades at walls and constantly moving despite having a clear shot at me bad. If this were Xcom I would have lost a lot more territory since I never upgrade security. My security with only 3 people under my control can take on 5 enemies with only pistols and one double barrel shotgun.\n\nRegrettably this game is not worth the 40 dollars in its current state.

While I do highly recommend this game to anyone who likes tactical or resource management games, if I could actually give this a numbered score it'd be a 6 or 7. Here's why.\n\nWhat the game does right:\n- The world feels like it's alive and breathing around you. Random events happen, but they always feel like they've been led up to with foreshadowing. Sure, you might randomly get attacked by a rival gang but you definitely saw it coming, the attack doesn't surprise you, and if you were in their shoes you'd do the same thing.\n- In the same vein, the fact that every henchman is a specifically designed person with their own relationships with other potential henchmen is amazing! Every little bit of this game oozes personality and identity.\n- The depth of management of your empire is huge. If you REALLY like games where you have to think and plan out the use of your resources and keep an eye on every little bit of minutea, this is your game. There are pages upon pages upon pages of reports and charts and financial analysis and stat sheets. I'm a data analyst, and the report tabs are a data analysts wet dream. I could make like 20 more points like this around faction relations and trade deals and alcohol management and this that and the other thing but I'll just say the \"Civilization VI\" style management part of this game is phenominal.\n- The initial game balance. You really do feel like a new mob boss at the start with what you have access to and the resources you have. You don't feel like a random dude that has no business being here, but you also know you're a small fish in a big pond.\n\n\nWhat the game could improve:\n- Combat, while fully functional, has some issues. The AI of your opponents all has the \"chrysalid\" AI from XCOM. In a game where the AI use guns, that takes a lot of the tactical challenge out of it. I'm playing on the highest difficulty and pasting everyone. Yes, I have 800+ hours in XCOM, but this feels line the same level of challenge I'd get on normal in XCOM.\n- Machine guns are unbalanced. When you fire a machine gun, you do burst fire. That involves firing three separate shots. The shots do around the same damage as a shotgun slug, work between close and medium range just fine, and have good overall accuracy. In what world wouldn't you use this weapon against literally anything?\n- It could do a better job explaining overworld controls. It took me 2 hours to learn I could center on my crew by hitting tab in the overworld. Same goes for keyboard shortcuts, I still haven't found the shortcut for pause.\n\nWhat the game is horrible at:\n- \"Boss\" powers are PAINFULLY overpowered. One of the bosses straight up unloads an entire pistol clip, and if he kills an enemy while firing he just continues shooting at the next one. Another one runs up and does 3 melee hits that do 50+ damage each, and if you kill someone you get all your AP back and the ability comes off cooldown meaning you can do it again. These powers feel like an instant win button.\n- Challenge Scaling. So, I'm playing on the highest difficulty. I got into a gang war with a massive gang when I had one henchman. I took out one building, defended another, and then I said fuck it and went after the mob boss for fun after saving. When I actually managed to take down their safehouse I just straight up got 11k and every single one off their rackets immediately, and somehow this didn't piss off anyone enough to come after me for it. I went from having 4 buisnesses to having close to 20 overnight, and I know for a fact if I keep going I'll keep growing exponentially. The entire challenge of the game is gone.\n- Between these two things I'm literally having to limit myself to give myself a challenge. \"You can't use the DLC Weapons. You're not allowed to attack a safehouse until the rival gang is down to X number of rackets left.\" Etc, etc. When I'm on the highest difficulty and I'm inventing my own challenges and restrictions to follow, something has gone horribly wrong in balance.\n\nSummary: This game is definitely fun, and both the theme and the resource / empire management save it and make it something special. The combat almost needs a complete overhaul though. DEFINITELY buy it if the genre and setting are your thing, skip it otherwise for now.

Empire of Sin seems to have this weird dichotomy between many of it's mechanics and the actual gameplay. \n\nAt the start it gives the suggestion of a deep narrative, and as you go along you're presented with various story-based objectives and side objectives which appear to differ depending on which boss you start the game with. It's this narrative and familiar Xcom style of gameplay that sparks your interest and keeps you going while you're almost expecting the gameplay to become more varied as you keep playing. But that just never happens. You very quickly realize the monotony of building the same 4 kinds of buildings over and over again and that this is indeed the whole game. It's not at all like Omerta where you had many different kinds of businesses to open that played into a variety of mechanics. No, this is the same 4 buildings that all serve the purpose of making money that you just build over and over again. For hours all you do is take over a place, bit of combat here, build your 10th or 20th speakeasy/brothel/casino/brewery, & repeat. Someone else said this game was like a board game, and yeah that's pretty much spot on.\n\nIt's both disappointing and weird to me that they went in this direction and it kind of makes me think they had to have had a different idea of where to take this game at some point because there's some really cool stuff in this game that suggests that. There are a lot of bosses to play as, each have their own storyline, unique personalities and perks. There are a ton of gangsters you can hire, and they even have relationships with each other where they're friends, lovers or enemies. You can promote them to important positions in your gang. You can get gear for yourself and your gangsters, even unique gear from killing other bosses. All of this to me hints at a much deeper game than it is. So when I was playing it I kept thinking \"Well there HAS to be more to it than this, right?\" But no, disappointingly, there just isn't. \n\nIt's a real shame too because I genuinely love so much about this game like the characters, the combat and especially the music (although hearing that \"upgrade complete\" music every time was really annoying after a while).

This game has different gangs with different bosses to pick from. The bosses have empire bonuses, like discount to racket upgrades and an extra guard in certain rackets and so forth. They have a special fighting move, like one ricochets a bullet to 3 targets and one charms someone with smoke which causes them to switch to your side but take damage until they die. And they have a special bonus, like trade deals being 10% more likely to be accepted or truces lasting 50% shorter or so forth. The bosses are all based off either historical characters or from fiction. Al Capon is of course a selectable boss.\n\nIn game each boss has their own main mission chain and there are small missions or mission chains that appear around the map. Like right now I'm in a middle of a mission chain where I'm up against a gang from canada that makes poisoned maple syrup. I had a branching choice to poison a rival's booze with their syrup which would have made me profit but hurt the citizenry, or rat them out to a member of the rival gang. I'm eager to see how it goes.\n\nRackets can be bought if unowned, they can be liberated from hostile thugs, and they can be captured from rivals. If a enemy gang wants to target your racket, a mark will appear on the racket. You can rush over there if necessary, or if you've upgraded your security you might have enough guards there to beat them without your gangsters. You'll be controlling the guards there when it's attacked.\n\nThe map is divided into neighborhoods on a map. Gangs can control a neighborhood. There can be as many as 10 or as few as 3 neighborhoods. There can be as many as 13 or as few as 6 rival gangs. You can hire gangsters, which come from history or fiction like the bosses, and possibly put one as an underboss in a neighborhood. Different gangsters have different bonuses to the neighborhood when placed as an underboss. It's possible to synergize a gangsters bonuses by specializing a neighborhood. In the neighborhood I started in, I placed enough casinos that it gained the nickname \"Gambling Strip\". I don't know what other neighborhood titles there are.\n\nI like how this game is so far. Since it's published by paradox, there's likely going to be a lot more development in the form of big free updates that come alongside DLC that add even more.

Both your units and the enemy units have so much health that getting hit doesn't feel like a significant consequence, and it feels like the way hit percentage is calculated often doesn't make sense with your positioning (why do I have 70% hit chance to shoot this man 1 tile over with a shotgun, while I have 90% hit chance on this guy who is literally obscured by an entire truck?). All added up, positioning feels like an afterthought. I won the first story mission I did after the tutorial by pressing 1 (the button to shoot) over and over until all the enemies died, without moving.\n\nThere's also other cases of dubious design: In said mission (this is in Stephanie St. Claire's campaign) the game made me run several blocks across town to meet a butcher, who told me to go back to my HQ to talk to a guy, who then made me follow him back to the butcher - and walking takes a long time! This also somehow took *twenty-eight days* in the game. That's more amusing than a real problem, but it doesn't exactly make for great immersion.\n\nOther than that, the UI is frustrating. Most UI elements either have no tooltips, or the tooltips only show stuff like how certain numbers are made up of other numbers. Coupled with some really cluttered screens, this feels like a big no-no for a strategy game in general, and in particular as a person with ADHD this makes this part of the game borderline unfathomable.\n\nIt also has other problems like poor voice acting and animations, and some very stilted writing and dialogue, but I'm willing to overlook all that because I can tell they were earnestly really trying for something.

I love the setting of 1920's Chicago, mobsters and love the genre of grand strategy. However, even though for these reasons I'll probably still occasionally play it, I would advise all others not to buy Empire of Sin in its current state. The issue with the game is not the ideas and concepts, rather, the execution. While combining business management, Paradox diplomacy, turn based strategy, and an RPG looks good on paper, they all have their own issues that break the game. Business management aspects are rather dull, requiring massive amounts of capital to upgrade businesses anywhere from 2-6 thousand an upgrade, while the income may only be a few hundred. The same applies for purchasing weapons, a normal pistol may cost as much as an entire brewery of yours. Diplomacy is fairly meaningless, as deals that are stuck are comically meaningless. The combat is alright, not new or innovative or bad and buggy, just average. RPG aspects are dull and lacluster, as character developments don't have much of an inmpact and negative effects can be easily circumnavigated. While these are all poor in their own right, what ruins the game is the AI. The AI won't attack, expand, or do much of anything. They just kind of sit there. As the player all you have to do, is kill an enemy boss at their safehouse and you win all of that gangs possesions, After killing two or three boses, you basically win the game. This coupled with completly dumb AI strategy ruins the game. This game is much closer to being in Alpha compared to a finally release state. I\"m not one for complaining without offering solutions, so here are a few suggestions that I would make to improve the game. \n\nOverhaul the economic systems \nCompletly fix the AI \nMake gang wars feel real\nHave enemy bosses switch locations, so you have to gain on intellegence first for a suprise hit \nPerhaps require a certain ammount of captured businesses before confronting a boss? \nGive other ways to win the game besides killing boses \n\nOverall, there a tons more suggestions I could make but I'm sure many more players will make them as well. This game is in need of a No Man's Sky type overhaul. The foundations are there, yet this game needs to work out all the kinks, bind the systems together, and vastly improve the AI's strategy for this game to become the ultimate gangster game it was marketed as and I hope it can become.", "timestamp_created": 1606946421, "timestamp_updated": 1606946421, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81489745": {"recommendationid": "81489745", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970905973", "num_games_owned": 448, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 532, "last_played": 1607100847}, "language": "english", "review": "God, I want to love this game.\n\nIt's too easy.

Forced into wars, a few missions etc.  Maybe if the speed could be adjusted on how many things are thrown at the player at once it'd be a good thing.\n\nThe underwhelming part... You don't have to bother taking pieces and parts of another bad guy's area. just go take his safe house and you get everything he owned.

Finally, the more alcohol you have the more money you make, the more gangsters you can buy and the more competition you can eliminate. This brings me to my main problem with the game...\n\n- Last and definitely not least, the biggest problem is that there's no way to win other than hostile or semi-hostile take over. There's no diplomatic, uniting-the-families type victory or really anything but eliminate the competition. The game overall is very bare-bones, personally I would like to see the depth of resources, governments, policies, units, etc. of that of stellaris or HOIIV rather than something like civ5/6 (which would also be a step forward for this game). \n\nTLDR: Game too barebones needs updates or DLC to add extra dynamics to the game. Yes I only have 9 hours, and it came out yesterday but I am VERY confident in my opinions of the current version of this game. Wouldn't recommend right now but in 6-12 months it could be much better.\n\nEdit: Formatting", "timestamp_created": 1606946078, "timestamp_updated": 1606946350, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506172835826873779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81489409": {"recommendationid": "81489409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192714966", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 553, "last_played": 1607187665}, "language": "english", "review": "No replay-ability 10h max of gameplay, everything is unbalanced like snipers and rifles, many many bugs, softlocks often, the auto saves are in bad points. id say it was worth it if it was \u00a320 but anything over that is a scam. i would love a refund because about 9h of gameplay in this were trying to fix being softlocked or being afk because i got bored. there is no direction and the story isnt indivual enough its always the same, just kill the other bosses and you win, no not by doing story missions which would actually be better. by the late game you kill everyone in one shot and can just chain kill every enemy in sight, good balance (not).

You pick a boss with unique abilities and set out carving out an empire in prohibition-era Chicago. Build rackets, gun down rivals, etc etc. You can do pretty much everything you'd expect out of a gangster game, and there is a pretty cool logistical planning and optimization element to the mid-game.\n\nIt benefits (in my mind) from there not being any comparable modern game to compare it to that also adheres to the organized crime genre. If we're being honest, it also is a better game at launch than most other games have been that are under the Paradox banner (looking at you, Imperator: Rome, which continues to be a worse game now than this is at launch).

You don't have to do anything to get that info, and whether or not you keep up with this micromanaging can be the difference of having no income and being the richest player in the game\n-The police AI seems broken, they rarely conduct raids on your businesses, and if they get suspicious about one of your businesses u can close up shop for very little in game time and they will forget they had any suspicion at all.\n-In combat, the police AI are bloodthirsty terminators, who will put you in handcuffs and then shoot your defenseless goon until he full on dies rather than arresting them. They have way better aim than any of the early or mid game characters and do crazy damage for seemingly unknown reasons.\n-Goons are not necessary, but make the game astronomically easier, the only problem is they take flat percentages of your total income, so when u hire a guy you pay him like 10 grand just to join up, then he takes 3-10% of your TOTAL income every week depending on how OP he is\n\nTL;DR: Like lots of games, ton of potential but just way too many problems to recommend it at this point.

I had it preordered and it was a tossup whether I'd be more into this or Cyberpunk. After all, it's a management sim with a mafia theme and tactical combat. It's basically made for me.\n\nExcept it's not. It's not for anyone. Its initial strong charm wears off quickly when you get into the flow of the game, which it's clear nobody put much time into. Your character's unique traits, promising a customized experience, aren't particularly useful, coming in randomly once in a while, but never telling you exactly what happened. The sit-downs, supposed to be a clash of personalities, are invariably an exchange of zingers followed by an offer of sharing bonuses. The management part is fine for what it is, but traveling around the world map is an infuriating exercise in zooming out, zooming out some more, sometimes zooming out a third time to go to a place and then you can interact with a building and do your talking or fighting. There are a zillion missions that come in from nowhere, far too many to track, and all of them basically have the same flow. It quickly becomes clear that the game has shown its whole hand in the first minutes and you're just going to see the same things over and over again.\n\nSpeaking of repetition, there's the combat. The thing you spend most of your time doing. You can essentially win any fight by just shooting over and over and over again. Terrain doesn't matter, placement doesn't matter beyond line of site, AI is terrible, and everyone is outclassed. And combat is the endgame of every interaction, as far as I can tell. There's no autoresolve; it's just endless fight after endless fight.\n\nIf there's violence in a mob game, it needs to be visceral. And it's not. It's a sanitized gunfighting game where there are dozens of people standing in the line of fire, who you can't hurt. There are no civilian casualties. You can only hurt other criminals. Even accidentally. I don't WANT to kill civilians, but the fact that I never accidentally hit one in dozens of firefights kept taking me out of the game. \n\nThe game might be fun enough without the combat, but the combat kills fun as efficiently as your gangsters kill nameless thugs. \n\nI want to wait and see if this gets patched into something good. But there's a fundamental sloppiness, from the animations to the systems that don't really interact with one another to the deluge of repetitive quests to the wasted subject matter and bland writing, that makes me think this is the game we get.

Don't get me wrong the concept is great.  The combat is more like a mini game and less like a xcom style fighting, if anything they should give you an option to auto combat and not have to sit there and click through a few goon kills.  The management aspect of the game is just ok at best.  You can upgrade your business but even that is very limited.  \n\nThere are a lot of options for characters to play but a create a character is basically needed in these type of games, which this completely lacks.  The \"acting\" of the characters is pretty terrible.  They basically have 2-3 motions each during dialog.  The dialog is very limited in choices, and most options don't seem to mater.  You can make a deal with a mob boss just to leave the room and have them cancel your deal, or want more money because you are to close to their territory, its almost better not to talk to bosses until needed.... Once you meet one boss every other boss will end up coming up in your path and soon war will be on the streets.  The game seems like it wants you to go slower but doesn't really give you much options in terms of thinking about decisions.  No pause button, no button to speed up time, these are basic tools in games like these that this game lacks.  \n\nThe management in the game is a lot to take in at first, once you see there isn't much you can actually do and you are just looking at data its a little less overwhelming.  You have to manage your businesses as well as your crew.  Some of your crew will have relationships with other people in the game which you can then use to your advantage.  People you hire may leave you if their moral goes down to far....Their moral can go down simply by being attacked in combat....THIS IS THE DUMBEST....I have had a member of my mob leave after leveling them up a bit simply because they were attacked in battle to much, not even downed in battle just hurt....  There are only a few options in terms of what you can build in the town....this is kind of lame since this is basically a city management game.   I think there are 5 business you can have...5....wow put a lot of thought into that.  Each building you can upgrade aspects of but it takes time and money for little rewards.  \n\nAs mentioned earlier combat is super basic.  The AI is terrible, just straight up dumb sometimes.  Goons jumping out of cover and running straight into fire is crazy AI.  It can often be chaotic when at war with other mobsters.  Fights break out all over the map basically at the same time.  Your main characters wont be anywhere near and you will have to fight with your guards.  These fights are sooooo boring.  You also find yourself fighting with cops that you don't want anything to do with.  A thug may start a fight with you on the road and cop may see it.  You then have to kill the cop and lose points against their faction for no reason....The cop saw me get shot at first, why am i getting arrested its called self defense.  I didn't even shoot at the cop during combat until all the thugs were down. They should thank me not arrest or attack me, or at least give me an option to bribe the cop to leave me alone.    \n\nBugs bugs bugs in this game.... Its like an early access game but its full release lol.  There are still a ton of game breaking bugs in this game.  My game constantly gets stuck in combat when switching from gunning someone down to melee .  Some combat actions seem to be glitched/spammed on the toolbar such as having 9 overwatch actions on the tool bar which makes it impossible to do a normal attack since that button is pushed off screen.  Characters often don't move when you want them to on the main map.  \n\nOverall i would rate this game somewhere between Meh and Ok... It has so much potential to be better if they get rid of the bugs and maybe shape up the AI a little more.

Force characters to lay low after shooting in public, or taking over properties.

It feels very incomplete with a lot of very simple issues being overlooked, so I think it should be marked early access.\n\nHere's a list of issues I can think of off the top of my head at 13 hours of playtime. There are probably much more but this is a fairly low effort list. I'm sure another comment has gone into a deep dive over many issues both mentioned and unmentioned here\n\nGameplay:\n- There is no real management required here. One large brewery can sustain a lot of speakeasy buildings and when the neighbourhood value increases you just press one button and change your production. That's it for production management.\n- The ai has wandering groups of grunts that explore for them while you only have your main group. It would be nice if we could send out people to explore without micromanaging them\n- A lot of diplomacy features seem to be missing. You have a truce with another faction? The only indication of when it ends is in the relations tab and it will say something like +120 (-20). So every week it'll go down 20 and once it's at 0 I assume the truce ends.\n- When you meet new crime lords, you have to make an option on the spot on how you want to treat them. With no prior knowledge of them you just have to judge at face value whether you want to threaten them or make a deal with them. There is no ignoring them.\n- Battles are crazy repetitive with a lot of balancing issues. My current go to is easily a rifle and high power pistol because they both have the highest damage and you can use 1 action point to attack with pistol and then 1 action point to kill an enemy (rifles are one shot kills a lot of the time).\n- In battles corpses can block tile movement unless you put your mouse right to the edge of the tile.\n- Another battles issue is that melee actions are very odd to handle. A lot of the time your guy will stand out in the open because you didn't realise that was the only place you can punch someone\n- AI is very silly. Often it leaves very good cover and enters a flanked position. This includes your characters when a battle starts. When you attack a building you are randomly places inside with enemies usually surrounding you so you're flanked on all sides. (Why don't we start by the entrance?)\n- There are some odd key bind choices like being able to end pause by pressing escape conflicting with me just wanting to open the menu while the game is paused.\n- You cannot issue movement commands to your squad if the desired location is too far away. You have to right click relatively nearby to them for the pathfinding to work\n\nDisplay:\n- Count values, due to being doubles, lead to weird number displays like having 207.0042256 barrels of whiskey.\n- There is no fullscreen borderless. You either play in a window or you have to completely minimize your game to do something else\n- The quest / mission tab is a complete mess an hour into gameplay because every civilian that wants you to do something in an explored area automatically gets put in there. It would be nice to have the progression missions, accepted optional missions, and unaccepted optional missions all in different sections\n\nAudio:\n- The mixing is very off. Voices are at a nice volume but then you shoot a gun and it is so obnoxiously loud.\n- Voice acting is extremely sub-par with a lot of the characters.

You can be allies with someone who goes to war with someone in a different district, and you can ask to take a few buildings in that district and then you can get a foothold in there and its just you and your ally. You could then betray your ally with outside help and take over that district. \n\nI get why everyones disappointed with the racket system, I am too, but I think its a little too much to ask to have a system similar to Omerta: City Of Gangsters which was extremely in depth with several different forms to make the same kind of money.

However it is not very polished and has a lot of minor issues and a few major ones. For instance my best campaign so far was ended because I destroyed a faction, and that dead faction would try to talk to me later which would immediately freeze the game, forcing me to Alt+F4 it and restart. Loading back into that campaign would lead to that same thing happening soon after the save, so a multiple hour long campaign is just ended due to a bug. The minor issues include things like unskippable conversations (which are about the same between every boss, so get old fast), character pathing getting stuck while exploring on the map, and the game hanging mid-combat while it seems to be calculating something. The game is basically still in a beta state with many bugs, some of which are game breaking so I cannot recommend it in its current state.\n\nHowever, the game has a lot of upgrades over Xcom 2 which is the closest game I have played to this style. There is a percentage chance to hit predictor that updates as you mouse over tiles a character can move to. The percentage chance to hit does not lie from what I can tell, whereas in Xcom 2 the player will miss more shots the better they do in missions, so the RNG is wildly inaccurate once you get into a campaign. You recruit the same basic soldiers early, but with their relationships you can recruit some late game people earlier in the campaign so you can recruit a wide variety of people. You can also influence how their traits are gained to an extent, making each soldier slightly different in every playthrough. If the developers work on this game it has a chance to be great, it is just not currently in a fun state as players will just get frustrated with the glaring bugs and other issues.\n\nEDIT: As an update to this review, the bug that initially prevented me from progressing was fixed, and I was able to finish my first campaign. However upon starting a new one on the next higher difficulty I was unable to attack any territories as whenever I clicked to attack the game just ignored my input.

Personally I havent encountered any bugs or glitches and my only issue is balancing as some units have abilities that can literally wipe out an entire room of enemies in one turn. While hilarious/ cool to see one time it happens quite often over time when using some units. Besides that the rest of the game is fun and interesting, the sit down mechanic in particular was well made and enjoyable as you banter back and forth with the many different personalities.

Combat/Global War.\nIt has two stages.\nFirst - you paid for two mercs and you steamroll everything. Thug buildings, enemy rackets, random guards on the street, you name it.\nSecond - when you attack enemy safehouse game suddenly boosts guards stats and numbers. Which is understandable since you're coming for their boss. But there is no difference between boss with 100k cash, 100k hooch and 100 rackets, and boss with nothing. Number of guards, their toughness will be same.\nWhich means when you can crack one safehouse without losing anyone in the process - you just won the game.\nYou don't need to slowly bleed your opponent out of money, muscle, hooch or whatever. You just go to safehouse, win boss fight and that's it. You just got what he had.\n\n2. Management.\nPrices in game have no sense in terms of upgrade. Meaningful (and there are not many) upgrades cost almost as much as full new racket which is x4 times more effective.\nThen you realise that it is not effective to spend money to buy buildings when it is far easier to just conquer every minor faction you come across cause they can't defend themselves.\nThe only upgrade i did in my game is to get increse quality of hooch. that's it.\nGuns and everything war related is found in crates in your starting neighborhood, so you don't need to buy them really.\nJust buy some med kits before safehouse mission and that's it.\nPlaying \"tall\" like getting your neighborhood only for youself and getting upgrades is basically non-existent unless you are really forcing it.\n\n3. Diplomacy.\nEver played any Civilization?)\nSame here. Like really same.\nConstant changes in the mood day by day. I had moments when two factions were in and out of their alliance daily for a couple of weeks.\nBribing police for relationship is super expensive. And you will basically win whole game before being able to really have this money to spend on this.\n\nSummary.\nBugs aside game is mediocre at best.

The game itself, in my 2 hours of play, didn't have any bugs or weird issues but the structure of the game itself makes this a lot less fun than I was hoping.\n\nI came into this hoping for a strategic crime family simulator with x-com style combat.  You sort of get that from this game but it's rendered a lot less fun by confusing menus, too much stuff going on, and a frustrating real-time with pause feature.\n\nIn the game you control a squad of mobsters and can run around a map to attack other factions or neutral thugs to either ransack, destroy, or take over their rackets (the games term for illicit businesses falling into one of five or six varieties).  All of that is, in theory, good however the financial aspect of the game is pretty confusing.  The game seems to favor rapid expansion into rackets rather than upgrading the rackets you have.  I made this mistake early on by spending my early game cash improving my rackets rather than expanding and was stuck in this cycle of having to assault and ransack neutral locations to earn money or go to war with an enemy faction with my 3 gangsters.  The game's tutorial has you recruit two additional gangsters and that ends up costing you $600 in wages when my rackets (2 speakeasies and a brewery) earned somewhere like $400.\n\nThe financial aspect was manageable but what really frustrated me was the absolute constant bombardment of missions and communications and events.  Within the first 20 minutes of the tutorial ending I was invited to war in conjunction with another faction.  I assumed it was in the neighborhood I occupied but, no, it was in fact a separate neighborhood I'd never been to.  I then was getting attacked in new businesses I got as a result of the war and didn't even know where they were and didn't have the ability to pay to upgrade them due to cashflow issues.\n\nI fully admit part of my issues are due to poor play and lack of familiarity with all the systems but the game honestly came off as a convoluted mess that couldn't really decide if it was a strategy game or an X-com game.  I know a lot of reviews have complained about bugs but I didn't really encounter any other than the game seemed very particular about clicking and sometimes something wouldn't work for no apparent reason and then all the sudden start working.  To me, the bigger issue is that the game itself feels haphazard and chaotic in an unfun way.  I never got to feel like I was a crime boss.

Cover doesn't really matter, getting shot doesn't hurt that much, but worst of all, the enemy AI is profoundly stupid. \nThey almost never get into cover, waste their time walking out into the open, and only sometimes attack. It's very strange to have a combat focus and have combat be this bad. Not to mention the bugs/strange design decisions that went into them. See, when you attack a racket/building from the outside (as in, you click attack on the building and go in guns blazing) you spawn in random spots in the building and start combat.

I assume it's a bug but it doesn't feel like one.\n\nThe management aspect feels tacked on and shallow and yet also too confusing and micro-intensive. You have to take over business personally and upgrade them by visiting them one at a time, which is just mindless busywork. The game feigns depth by giving you things like \"customer tastes\" and \"alcohol types\", but doesn't really explain much about it during the tutorials. This is of course, discounting the fact that you can just gun down the competition with minimal fuss.\n\nMost of all, this game just feels unfinished and rushed to release. Everything feels unpolished and janky..

All of your buildings (rackets) can be upgraded in a multitude of ways.\n\nThe gangsters you can recruit all have various skills they can learn and have a lot of unique quirks and perks.\n\nUnder the hood, this is a number crunching game. Supply and demand, percentages, bonuses all combine to give you your income. There are some neat \"poker\" mechanics when it comes to collecting various rackets in a district. 2 of a kind, full house, all give you added bonuses, so try to build in sets.\n\nThe combat is distinctly tile/turn-based combat. Move, get into cover, try and flank, shoot or melee. Each gangster can learn a few combat skill to flesh out the combat, but it's exactly what you think it'd be. If you like combat like this, you'll enjoy it here. Nothing new, just simple, solid mechanics.\n\nNow, there are a few issues with the game so far. A few movement bugs, sometimes characters t-pose when fast traveling, if you are doing the tutorial do not enter a sitdown when you get the popup for instance, adding armor to your characters, you won't be able to click dialogue buttons and will forever be stuck on that screen.\n\nSome audio sounds loop on top of each other, especially when there are multiple characters talking and the guns... they don't all sound great.\n\nBut, the aesthetic, the business aspect of the game as well as the story and sidequests really make this an interesting game and even if you have a passing interest, I would definitely pick this up. The positives far exceed the negatives and I feel like it will only get better with time.\n\nI don't regret getting this game, but if you're a little reluctant, just wait a month or so and it'll be on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1606925491, "timestamp_updated": 1606925491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81470767": {"recommendationid": "81470767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205002352", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 561, "last_played": 1613684988}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a good game just need some hot fixes and some more diffrent tipe of rackets and this game will be so good", "timestamp_created": 1606925160, "timestamp_updated": 1606925160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81470660": {"recommendationid": "81470660", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985671617", "num_games_owned": 792, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1606924467}, "language": "english", "review": "Every single save file corrupted after playing for two hours.

There are currently several bugs and balance issues (UI stops responding, Overwatch shots not triggering, AI spawning outside of the floor map) that need to be rectified before it can be enjoyable as well.\n\nI know I'm in the unpopular minority in that I care more about historical accuracy in my games than I ever will about socially-sensitive progressive agendas. Female gangsters were the exception during this time, not the rule. Furthermore, female and black police officers didn't exist. Ironically, willful ignorance in game development like this does more to destroy the history of how far the civil rights movement has come by pandering to contemporary culture, than it does to champion anyone's \"rights\".

Yet, it is held back by extremely shallow game design. Both aspects, the tactical combat and the economy sim, fall desperately short. \n\nThe combat lacks variety and any noteworthy innovations. Which could be fine on its own, but the combat A.I. is simply the shoddiest I've seen, significantly worse then the original XCOMs 25 years ago. Most enemies simply walk close, do nothing, and get killed. That's it, without special enemies or inventive weapons, every combat feels the same, and it doesn't change with difficulty. \n\nThe economy part is inconsequential to the game. Sure, it provides money, but that can be earned by quests and raiding. Other than titles like Civ or Stellaris, economy and politics cannot be used to influence the game other than providing money (or so it seems 5 hours in). The complexity of the economic system stops at one building making booze, the other 4 converting booze to money. All five types have the same incremental upgrades that have to be clicked once when there's money. Shame, because with the good UI and ample statistics the game promises to be fairly complex. But it just isn't.\n\nThe only strong side of the game is the squad selection, with a huge roster and intricate relationships between the characters. Don't expect DragonAge level of story here, but there are neat side quests for the crew that are worth following, simple branching decisions and unique rewards included.\n\nAnd no impression would be complete without mentioning the bugs. Game braking hangups, broken quest lines, audio occasionally lagging 3 seconds behind, bugged animations, permanently stuck overlays, stuck characters, long pauses, and questionable hit-percentages over long distances. How could all that pass QA? The bugs are easily found and fixable. Another obviously rushed release.\n\nThe game has potential, with good design over all it is definitely likable.

The turn-based combat is poorly developed, with AI behavior, combat mechanics, and one-line comments from characters that make it a frustrating process to click through.  The neighborhood/empire component of the game is also simplistic, with nothing required other than brute force expansion across the city, ignoring the largely unnecessary boss meetings that simply result in a classic boss fight with no opportunity for diplomacy or other outcomes long-term.  Character development, moral decision-making, and skill progression are also limited compared to modern standards.\n\nThere are also numerous bugs still in place, particularly in the combat interface, including characters not moving to squares, AI characters abruptly shifting clothing when animations are stitched together, and a clunky interface that borders on defective.\n\nSome of the graphics are very well designed and developed, including building interiors and the city street view (although, again, several bugs observed for building interiors).

I'm basically 50/50 on it, and I wish Steam would allow me to post the review as neutral with information in here instead of a 'recommend' or not... because the game has the bones of something really cool. The structure is there. The visuals are wonderful. The systems in place have potential. The idea is great, and 'almost' executed well enough for a recommendation - but alas, the details were ignored, the pacing isn't right, the entire concept of the AI having even a 2nd grade reading level was overlooked, and the trade/barter/negotiation system is all one-sided. You have no say over the core of what makes this game great, and therefore, it becomes mediocre at best. \n\nIt's an economy driven game, without the need to build much of an economy. It's a business simulator with no control over your prices. It's a multi-agency strategy game with no say over trades or negotiation terms (it's take what they offer you, or piss them off). It's a turn-based tactical combat game, without the need for proper tactics, even at Boss difficulty (the highest). It has many screens of in-depth information, but doesn't give you what you want to know when you want to know it. It'll interrupt your gameplay entirely with repetitive noises and loud crashing sounds for things you don't care about, and then fail to notify you on things you do care about. Even things like quest markers take an unusually long time to find on the map. It's as if they never thought allowing interaction with a quest would make the player want to know 'where' it takes place. A simple button to zoom in on the location would be best. Information such as what you're currently producing has no mouse-over at all (is that barrel swill or rack? I really don't know unless I go to another screen to find words next to the symbol. Why can't there be mouse overs on this stuff?).\n\nAlso... the strongest weapon in the entire game is the taxi. Don't bother investing in security. It's not needed. Just pause, taxi there instantly during pause with your hero, and blow the enemy up. \n\nIt needs improvements, and perhaps due to it's extensive modding capabilities, we'll get even more than the devs have planned... assuming they have it planned. I wish them well on their journey to make this game the great game it was meant to be. I hope they see the criticism in the reviews as an opportunity to improve it to something awesome, like No Mans Sky has done, and not something to abandon, like say... Phantom Doctrine. \n\nOverall right now, I give it a 6/10 -- and at $40, that's just not good enough. Wait for a deep sale now, or evaluate when it's had some patches, has improved it's AI greatly, has expanded it's availability of information, and hopefully has fixed Salazar's voice... because... well.. that voice has got to go.

I simply sold fake whiskey to everyone and become rich. I traded fake whiskey for the other gangs' guns, money, equipment etc.\n\nThe game is very casual and not a proper strategy or turn based combat game at this moment. I played Frankie Donovan as my gang leader. In combat I was using his melee special to two different oppents and they die generally. But after a while I took Run and Gun skill. Normally when you use your special if you kill an enemy your action points regenarates but you become exhausted. I understand that the developers do this for using the melee special safely and not often (use and hide, or go away) and it has 6 turns cooldown but if you use Run & Gun after you use melee special it resets your cooldown and you can use melee special 2 or 3 times in every turn. I found this simply after 2 hours of game time. I think they didn't playtested this game enough.\n\nAs a player I didn't face any consequences neither I didn't understand that what the AI gangs doing in 1 day in game time. No one has a turn or action limit in the game so I cleared 3 gang hombases in 1 day one after the other. I could even clear them all in 1 day. Travel to gang leader's base, declare war, kill everyone at the door, get in and kill everyone inside. This is it. Gang leader doesn't run, doesn't hide. No turn limit to complete the attack, or assault. No consequences... \n\nGame world and map is beautiful btw. There is a lot of variety for buildings and they look good. But the game has very limited interiors. \n\nI didn't understand what police does. I gave them money and they took money everytime but one exception. There is police on the world and they walk on the streets but I didn't see any police departmant or jail. Maybe I didn't look carefully.\n\nAll gangs have almost same buildings,  gang members (not special ones) and interiors. Lieutenant system doesn't work properly at this moment but they can fix it in no time.\n\nThey have added voiced dialogues for every gang leader and they feel different when they talk and act but their gang members and buildings and jobs all the same.\n\nBut even after all of this complaints I recommend this game for future. If developers love this game, their work. They will fix these problems. It is clear that they put a lot of work to this game and actually it is fun but not a porper strategy or turn based combat game fun.

I only have 6 or so hours on record, but fully expect to have at least 24 by the end of the week.

But these are not supposed to be the main focus of the game, and are just minor extrinsic motivators compared to what the game is designed for.\n\nMost of this \"review\" is expressing how the other reviews are wrong. And I understand that's in strange taste.

Anyone who is ok with this is why games suck shit now adays. \"let me copy your homework\" Fucking romero games.\n-The 2 companies behind this game are corrupt shills. 2 dlc before game even released with some locked characters and legendary items locked behind a paywall that make the game easy on hard. 9/10 rating? 4.5/5? On fake websites that look like they were paid to say so.\n-Some tier 1 companions better than tier 5 companions with unique weapons. same with tier 3. Paying extra for nothing.\n-Ambush heal abuse or safehouse teleport abuse,(doctor/boss unlocks heal skill and can heal outside of combat. Can avoid injured status and exploit game\"\n-Dialogue scenes/animation are cringe as hell. Kingdom Come level of acting and voicing lol.\n-No real penalty to being violent and creating sqaulor, reduces preffered liquor so most of the time boosts profits.\n-Too easy. Killed 7 crime bosses in the first 8 months on normal. Took me even less time on hard because now i knew which skills to get and which guys to hire.\n-Some of the animations glitch out, supposedly they were all done by 1 dude from paradox lol Hugh you did a good job but should of got someone to scan over your work or something.\n-Can just tp to someones HQ and kill them\n-Ai will declare war on you by itself with no hopes of winning\n\nGraphics are awesome, music is good, gameplay is fun but shallow. The premium version of this should be 40$ thats how much the game is actually worth to me not 80$. You can beat it in 3 hours if you wanted to so honestly base game should be like 20$\n\nNew dlc said new mechanics lets hope they are good, cant rob banks screw with the mayor attack police HQ, get the military called on you or anything as of right now so its kind meh.\n\nIf they released this game 10 years ago it would be a top hit, today day its repetative ugly and rushed. Paradox is crap in the fact that it never play tests its games they leave that up to you.

The game is obviously unfinished, this is Early Acess without the label, no doubts about it. There is an obvious vision that was torn to shreds by money hungry publishers and it breaks my heart to see it.\n\nFirstly, the gameplay, which can be split into two parts: Combat and Managment\n\nCombat is based on X-COM style strategy if a third grader designed it. Instead of your team going simultaniously, each character has a stat (Initiative) which determines when they act. The biggest number acts first. This sounds like a good idea on paper, but what ends up happening is you being massively overpowered and clearing 5 of the 6 goons before they even get a chance to shit themselves at the sight of you OR your entire squad gets beaten within an inch of its life and you're forced into spending your turn healing and repositioning. The early game is the best part because things are kinda balanced, since you don't have the equivelent of 5 highly trained navy seals on your team, instead you've got a half-blind man with a shotgun and your Boss, who more than likely is taking potshots with his pistol behind solid cover, yet still can't seem to hit the broad side of a barn. Nevermind the fact that there are numerous bugs which slow down gameplay, break how certain perks and skills work, alongside the AI, which at times is average and at others takes the idea of hiding behind cover as a cowardly suggestion rather than a good idea.\n\nThe managment side consists of managing your rackets (buildings you take over, most of them generating money or booze), making deals and maintaing or degrading your relationships with other mob families and kitting/leveling your crew. There are 6 types of rackets, which I won't go into detail about. There are plenty of youtube videos explaining them, but the jist of it is they are your primary source of income. The diplomacy is lackluster to say the least, each time you start a war the best course of strategy is getting a taxi to the enemy Safehouse, clearing them out and taking over everything they own. This takes about 10 minutes and 4-5 guys. RPGing your crew is so basic that it makes me fucking mad, you can equip a trinket, armor, 2 consumables, primary and secondary weapons along with different ammo types. Perks are fucking pathetic, due to the randomisation aspect of them. You end up hiring a guy to be a tank/close combat troop and he ends up with 4 perks about fucking sniper rifles and overwatch, making him glorified cannon fodder.\n\nThe story is... dull. It's not bad, but it's not good either. Can't really say much about it, if you can get into a simple mob story, you'll love it.\n\nGraphically unimpressive, it's got that roaring 20s vibe, but just kinda looks wierd at times. The game can't decide wether it should be taken seriously or not, so it ends up messing with the general immersion of it. The best example I can give is a crime family, whos leader is literally dressed up as a circus clown.\n\nAnd now the pudding, bugs. Bugs, bugs, bugs. So many fucking bugs. Graphical glitches, crashes, gamebreaking bugs, quests glitching, combat glitching, diplomacy glitching. Absolutely fucking pathetic. Releasing a game with these BASIC technical issues should be a crime.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is akin to a beautiful souffle filled with melted cow shit. Looks good at first, but then ya bite into it and you'd rather have just died. Wait a year for all the massive patches and DLCs to come out, wait for a sale on the season pass and don't pay a dime over 20 dollars/euros.", "timestamp_created": 1606908845, "timestamp_updated": 1606909484, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580419540405273438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81457717": {"recommendationid": "81457717", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977197672", "num_games_owned": 401, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 2125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 713, "last_played": 1612610787}, "language": "english", "review": "Empire Of Sin borrows from a lot of titles. If you've played X-Com before you can jump right into to a tactical fight here and you'll see all the terms and actions you're already familiar with.  Sure the theme lends itself to a  few unique twists here and there, but this isnt the deepest most brain burning turn based tactics game. \n\nBut the nod it took from Civilization 6 is particularly fascinating to me.  What Civ 6 does so well is make each individual game feel like its own little world and story.  No two games are exactly the same and each one finds you making new friendships/enemies and taking new approaches to victory.\n\nWhile the depth of Civ 6 far surpasses anything you'll see here, what Empire of Sin borrowed from that game it did REALLY well.   For me. Where each game feels like its own little gangster story in its own little universe.  The criticism that it all boils down to you having to take out each gang one by one is mind boggling to me.  In my games I've seen different gangs attack each other and ally each other at different times for different reasons.  And my gangs took different approaches to diplomacy. I've tried being very isolationist and I've been very trade happy.  I've made lots of friends and killed lots of enemies and had a lot of fun. Is it \"Samey\"... maybe... but no more or less than most of my favorite strategy titles.\n\nIt's REALLY light for a Paradox game.   This is NOT the EU/Hearts of Iron answer to the mafia.  This isn't even a really light crusader kings.  But this is a good thing to me.  I like those games but after awhile picking which friggin tire tread to go with on each tank becomes unfun... for me.   I like that this game pulls the lens back a bit and takes a bigger focus on the overall development of your gang and it's leader and members.  I get that some people are disappointed it doesnt have a Crusader Kings level of depth in this regard... but I'm not. I played CK and it's great... I dont need to play it again.   This game borrows from a lot of titles but it's for sure it's own thing and I like that.   And it's ok that it's a lot lighter than we are used to from that publisher.\n\nIt's not perfect. It can be a lot better and I have faith it will be. Theres soem bugs here and there but I'm not the kind of person that freaks out over this.  None of the bugs broke MY game, but reading the forums for just a few minutes and you'll find these things ARE happening to gamers in decent numbers.  I save a lot and if a mission bugged out for me ina  game I just ignored it and went forth trying to take over the city and was able to do so.   You may not be so lenient so I thought I'd share my experience.  \n\nBut as it stands I really like this game.  I can't tell you exactly what it is about that I like.  No one system is groundbreakingly original.   But the way it blends everything together is fun especially considering the prohibition era gangster theme.  I think the definitive organized crime strategy game has yet to be made, but this holds it's own in a genre that isnt overly saturated.   \n\nI cant tell you if it's worth it or not.  I dont see games that way.   Buying and playing games are two different mindsets for me.  Sure I wait for deals and discounts on certain titles while I decide if it's something I'll play at that time, but basically if I want something enough and decide to spend, I'm not worried about how much money was spent. Thats already gone. I'm worried about how much fun I'm having now and how much fun am I going to have in the future.   So to me, it's worth it. I'm having fun playing the game and I think it's going to get better.  If you're on a budget though maybe wait awhile. Games like this go on sale frequently and given some time I think many of the quirks will be ironed out.  But I do NOT feel like a beta tester as others have said.

After about 5 hours, my first playthough was done (I didn't even realize it at that time). \nThere are some deep mechanics, they don't really have any actual impact at all as some are just not meaningful in any way, not complete, or do absolutely nothing. \nBelow I will list the issues I have noticed, and will not include any bugs I encountered. \n\nI tried to play like a non-threatening boss at the start. Go to sitdowns rather than the other options. In the end I was always offered a business proposal, they would admire something about my empire and offer me some small perk. In return they would say something about \"cheap muscle\" and I can't figure out what I am supposed to do to hold up my end of the bargain.. I assume it has something to do with my security level, but I don't see any interactions that would let me do anything to help them. So that was a bunch of negative honor for failing to do my part. \n\nI started off doing the quests (which were overwhelming at the start as I didn't realize some were timed - which caused an original \"made\" person leave the crew - no problem I instantly hired them right back). But then once I took the first neighborhood, money (and thus making trades) was a non-issue. Also, CPU \"Hey help me in this war\" Me. \"Whats in it for me?\" and proceeds to check off everything the enemy owns.. CPU: \"Sounds fair\".. Me: does literally nothing, CPU wins war and gives me the entire empire they just took. o.O Along those lines too, once I started exploring other neighborhoods- since I was getting rackets in them from the CPU wars, I realized Chinatown was totally desolate besides minor factions. The CPU never expanded there or really at all. After ~8hr my first game, I had 60 rackets and the next closest boss was at 12. My money is over 10k per week that I just reinvest in upgrades to make more, and a ton more security. \n\nThe interiors are just there for looks. I'm not sure why there is mechanics like hired people can get STDs or drunk depending on if they are in one too long. I hung out in one to see if eventually they would go do their own thing, nope, everyone just stayed by me. I then thought maybe you were supposed to leave them there to defend, as some have perks that benefit a particular racket.. But why? Only being able to hire 10, I couldn't cover everything.. On that note, the defenses are a joke and you are forced to do them.. \"X is attacking your building!\" /fight  Cool my 6 guys Vs their 3, using just generic sawed off shotguns and pistols mostly. So boring and you have no chance to get yourself or any of your bosses to that random location - so again it is boring and basically pointless. At least let us Sim it when the odds are like that. \n\nOnce I took safehouses in other places, it asked me to make someone a Lt. I did, but they don't actually get promoted to that position and has no impact on gameplay since they still just follow me around. I also inserted someone as a Mole into Capone's group - 3 hr later no clue what impact that had. There was no additional options to have him do something, and I didn't get any secret info. You already get all the info you would need, down to \"their plans\" from the 1000 panels in game.\n\nLooking at the black book, I have 7 people from there. The AI owns 3 total, through all the other bosses.. The cheap people are decent, and get pretty strong when leveled up. But once they like you, then you can recruit their friends without reaching that notoriety level - and the higher level ones are gods, and the drawback is they are very expensive up front - except money is no issue. 99 marksmanship, just give them a sniper rifle - or regular rifle, and GG. They 100% whatever they can see.  Plus my entire crew likes each other besides one guy who loves someone who doesn't love them back. So the biggest mistake is to injure/down one of my guys because then everyone else goes into a rage and unloads on anyone they can see. It pretty much wipes the entire enemy squad and I did nothing at all. \n\nFinally the RPG elements feel shallow. Nothing has a meaningful game impact here either. It is basically if YOU want to roleplay a character a bit and self impose rules to follow. The sit down dialogue just makes no sense.. The last person I met was Sai Wing Mock.. His attitude was \"who are you, why should I care, you are nobody etc\" Well.... I have 60 rackets and you are down to your last safehouse.... soooooo... ok bye. \n\nIm sure the AI stupidity in combat has been beaten to death.. But I will add that during street fights, there is always some random thug or 2 virtually out of vision that gets involved in the fight. So after 3 rounds and everyone is dead, im like... Whaaaaaa? Oh, dude 2 blocks away is still running up.. Don't worry we'll wait.. Along those lines, when you attack a building, most of the safehouses seem to be the same map and everyone spawns at the door. but the other buildings? Why do some of my people start in a bedroom half way into the building? It isn't xcom where you can scout and setup before you are noticed/attack. \n\nRight now I am at 480 notoriety - nobody else in the game has 100 yet. I saw some smashed rackets but really, they AI just doesn't try to \"build an empire\" as much as they just chop each others legs off. I was hoping that it would be viable to go smash their breweries so they can't make money in the other rackets, but what is the point? There doesn't seem to be any reason to attack their economy over brute forcing shooting them in the face, ever.. Even if you raze it, it disables the building for a year - but in a year I could turn it into something useful.. And for what it's worth, I'm only 1.5 years into my game and it is LONG over. So that option basically removes the building for the entire game. \n\nOverall I'd give it a 6.4/10. Do I regret buying it? Not to the degree of \"I wish i refunded it\" necessarily - that is extreme for me. But would I recommend it to someone? No. Maybe if it was $20-30 and after seeing what they address.. But realistically I don't see a real reason to play through a second time, unless you really just want to be another boss or try a different strategy to win - which will probably work because the AI can't tie its own shoes, much less run an empire. \n", "timestamp_created": 1606904993, "timestamp_updated": 1606904993, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485303103923797607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81454965": {"recommendationid": "81454965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006781234", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 161, "playtime_at_review": 432, "last_played": 1618883199}, "language": "english", "review": "Haven't been this impressed with a new game for years!", "timestamp_created": 1606904814, "timestamp_updated": 1606904814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464774966239929199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81454823": {"recommendationid": "81454823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011918425", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 366, "last_played": 1606923951}, "language": "english", "review": "So, even I'm not that happy with the final game I do recommend it.

OF COURSE WE PUT AL CAPONE IN THE GAME. SCARFACE AMIRIGHT LOOK TOMMY GUNS AND OLD CARS TOO OMGGGGGGGG \ndo you understand what im saying?\n\nIt's like a Disney version of the 1930's\nThink of this game like this\n\nSid Meier's 1930's Chicago, with cartoonish feel and everything. \nSure it's designed to be graphic and scary - but it doesnt FEEL that way. \nIt feels so benign and dull, and not because it isn't a fleshed out game, but because the end product is so simple, so plainly ugly and so irreversibly untrue to the theme it's trying to present itself as.\n\nis dutch schultz in the game? no\nis Lucky Luciano in the game? no\nThere's so many notoriously hardcore gangsters they left out because it's hard to make a fun story about a guy who literally writes peoples names on bullets and probably jacks off into the shell casings\n\n\nbut that would be a theme, that would be an example of them staying true to the intended concept.\nYou want to be the mob boss of chicago in the 1930's right? Well i hope you like playing as a very narrow selection of overly personified characters that would better fit into a mafia as a henchmen, much less the refined chill of an actual mafia leader\n\nNo you can't make your own gang leader. There is NO CUSTOMIZATION WHATSOEVER.\nI swear to god game designers have water on the brain\n\nGangster the original pc game came out in like 1788 before Jesus was even born and you had a huge selection of gangsters who actually represented people of the era that just seemed to be down on their luck and were not always criminals. You could actually pick your mafia territory colors and create your own mafia leader. You could hire a lawyer to keep the heat off and even get you out of jail *you could be arrested*\n\nThis game is a huge blow to the gangster / mafia game industry. It's so many steps back that it's not even funny. It feels like hitting yourself in the face with a hammer when you play it.\n\nThe immersion breaking is limitless. Here's an exammmmmpppplleeeeee\n\n1.) EVERY. SINGLE. ORDER. \nthe enemy and your units make click sounds that acknowledge you've selected something. Which really ruins the whole \"hey we're in the 1930's listen to this old time music\" vibe, because EVERY SINGLE SECOND you'll hear that in battle. \n2.) The beeps. Sorry for ruining the game for you with this alone, but you'll never be able to ignore it now that i've pointed out how annoying the stupid beeps are along with the dumb clicks - AND DUDE YES IM TOTALLY SOBER - play the game, it's actually annoying. It's too frequent, too much and doesn't fit with the 1930's theme. It fits the X-com future computeristic feel.\n3.) Everything. Literally everything. I want to pull my hair out, bag it, and send it to the developers and just show them what damage they've done with this jizz sandwich.\n4.) The speed of the game. MY GOD i hate this. So in the old gangsters pc game, the speed was like realistic as heck. You would be like 58 weeks in before a war happened, 128 weeks and you're bribing people leading up to an election.\n\nIt this game on like day 5 you're at war, and by day 7 people are attacking every single business you own -\n\nWHICH BRINGS ME TO THE GAME BREAKING - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT MOMENT - you got this far, congratudlatons\n\nIn the old pc game, you got messages that people were killed, it was kinda sad sometimes because imagine after 128 weeks of watching this one guy just non-violently collect extortion money - like an honest man would - and suddenly your neighbor, The evil Nicholas Gambiatti, sends a bunch of guys to shoot him and the money he was carrying, suddenly you're getting tons of obituaries in the news that's presented at the end of the week, time is paused when you get the end of the week briefs so you can chill and actually consider what happened, you can actually see how you went from having 58 gangsters to 24 and how you've lost territory all across the city, how people no longer pay extortion because the OLD GAME actually had an in depth extortion system where you had to beat up people if they didnt pay so that OTHER people got the message, and if they still didn't listen, you torched their store, kidnapped or flat out murdered them in public to make other people keep paying and new people agree to paying your extortion.\n\nIt was a beautiful game and i held out hope that this would be it's successor but hope is a beautiful liar.\n\nIn this game you can select from about 5 business types, we won't even mention how many businesses the old 90's pc game had because you'll laugh at how far back this step is.\n\nOkay so you understand the notifcations for people dying in the old game though, now you'll understand why i bring it up.\n\nin this game, when on day 8 some random guy decides to goto war with you even though realistically that's going to ruin his own empire with police attention and such, you'll be attacked at literally (yes literally) every single location you control - which would be fine if it were like the old game and you could just assign guards, and they would do what they were supposed to do.\n\nbut this game is all bones and no meat. It has the x-com combat system and that's all it is.\n\nso every single instance of combat, you're expected to fight. 1 of your guards against 7? sure you can run away but if you want your guard to just fight, YOU have to fight the whole battle. and some battles cant be ran away from, like casinos you own. you have to fight.\n\nso you fight in the casino, you win, maybe you lose. it was maybe fun, who knows.\n\nbut you own 12 businesses, and a bunch of rackets.\n\nso you have to do that 11 more times.\nat least.\n\nand it stops being fun\nand this is your first time playing\nand you realize i was right and you need a refund before that 2 hours is up because this actually sucks\n\nit's just x com\nthere's no mafia in this garbage\nthe fighting system is absolute trash, \nthe sounds of the guns are lame and outdated by about 20 solid years, \nthe character progression system is aids, \nthe aiming system is cancer\nthe characters are boring\n\n\nThe developers should have to drink a gallon of piss for making this", "timestamp_created": 1606900226, "timestamp_updated": 1606900226, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609165728092193604", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81451542": {"recommendationid": "81451542", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992722681", "num_games_owned": 595, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 170, "last_played": 1606854189}, "language": "english", "review": "Right now I'm sad to say that I really can't recommend this game. It has potential, but all the systems don't really gel together nicely at all. Combat is very slow and very low stakes most of the time (on the middle lieutenant difficulty) where you're mostly fighting worthless thugs that are no real threat. Your crew regenerate as you walk around the city, so I never had to use a healing item or send anyone back to my safehouse. They should really have limited combat to anything involving at least one named gangster on both sides and replaced the rest with timers - I spent most of my game murdering thugs and ransacking empty buildings for money, which wasn't too bad because my boss had an ability that basically insta-killed three people - but it would be very dull to fight them all out normally.\n\nCombat was so easy on this average difficulty that everything else kinda becomes pointless. I played for 2.5 hours and I could walk in and murder an enemy boss with nothing more than one guy injured, and I hadn't been trying all that hard in the fight. Then you get their whole empire, which is 1000% faster than fighting thugs and taking rackets one at a time. It would make more sense for it to splinter into minor factions or you get some of it based on your stats / reputation etc. It's a shame because combat again has potential, it's just a little slow and clunky right now, and almost all your battles are boring busy-work with no danger.\n\nThere are quests, for some reason. You teleport to a place (or walk there the first time) and talk to someone, maybe have a fight. It's fine, but on top of everything else happening it feels chaotic. Right now I have two management quests (get x rackets/x weekly income), my boss personal story quest, a gangster personal story quest, and a bunch of random quests about random things/people. It's a bit much and none of it seems to have a huge impact on the game.\n\nSpeaking of which, boss sitdowns are a disappointment. You can't seem to be proactive at all (maybe I missed some buttons or something), and the bonuses from doing a deal are pathetic - 2% cheaper security upgrades? Come on, give me at least 10-20%. You can establish defensive pacts and stuff as I saw when I negotiated about joining someone else's war, but right now any war can be ended instantly by marching into the enemy safehouse, so eh.\n\nUpgrading your breweries to make better booze and choosing what booze they make is the most interesting management aspect. Sadly the other racket upgrades are all mostly just positive - word of mouth makes you a bit more likely to be raided as well as making things more popular, but other stuff is just better. Again, it takes so much time to get these upgrades and so much money, when you can just go murder an enemy boss or raid 10 thug buildings and ransack them for far more cash.\n\nYour gangsters are named and have personality traits and relationships, which is potentially very cool but doesn't matter with current combat at standard difficulty. There are tonnes of guns and weapons and grenades and armour and powerups to equip, even different ammo types! But it doesn't really matter when the mooks you're fighting tend to be the same set types of pistol guy, shotgun guy, machine gun guy, melee guy, without any really exciting abilities to be concerned about.\n\nEverything is just so close to being awesome, but there are too many annoyances. Too many boring pointless battles. Too many quests that don't really matter. Sitdowns with insignificant bonuses. Too much going on to make it worth trying to manage and upgrade your rackets.

There's a lot ooooo to the game, but a lot of ehhhh, too. \n\n\nPros:\n\n- Atmosphere ranges from meh to woah at times. The city looks gorgeous and lively. Old timey cars rumble through the streets and pedestrians fill the sidewalks. Though I wish there were more soundtracks, the few that are there are pretty kickass. Jazz with a little bit of metal/industrial mixed in at times to give it an edge. I have to point out that one seems suspiciously similar to the Mos Eisley Cantina theme from Star Wars, but I'm hesitant to call it a ripoff. Could just have been a common jazz riff of the time. Either way, I liked it. \n\n- Gameplay loop is fun for a few hours. Even though the tactical combat is kind of ehhh compared to games like X-Com or Phoenix Point, there's still a little excitement knowing every move you make is growing your empire.\n\n- It's been a long time since I've played dedicated tycoon games, but the business side of things seems fine. Lot of min-maxing you can do to make sure potential customers are heading to your establishments over the competition. And of course, failing that, you can always go and get rid of any competition with pew pew. I wish all tycoon games were like this. It could stand to have some more production chains and racket types, though.\n\n- A lot more quests than I expected in this. Every one of your gangsters has their own personal one, from your main boss to the hired help, at least from what I've seen. There's also quite a few side quests as well. Some are so basic they're not worth doing, others are more interesting and can have severe consequences/benefits for you. The storytelling in them is basic, but there is some intrigue here or there.\n\n- Speaking of quests, there's quite a bit of voice acting and dialogue options. Some can get repetitive, and the dialogue ranges from passable to cheesy, but I think it's overall a benefit.\n\nCons: \n\n- Animations need polish. People look fine in the 'overworld' where people are just standing or walking around. But once they start doing combat maneuvers they just look unnatural. Lot of sliding around and awkward turning. Melee attacks look like they're being performed by manequins moved by giant puppet strings. I don't usually give a crap about this kind of thing but for the first few battles it was very distracting. \n\n- Tactical combat gets repetitive fast. It's saved by the fact it's only a part of the game, but if it was all the game had to offer? No way would I recommend it. I haven't fought the cops yet, so I can't say I've seen all the enemies in the game, but god is there a lack of variety in most of them. Same dudes with the same models with the same three types of weapons, with no variety in special abilities that I could see. I get that the time period doesn't really allow *that* much variety, but I can think of a few things: \n\nHow about enemies manning mounted heavy machine-gun turrets that you gotta go behind to kill? How about attack dogs? How about dedicated medics who can go around buffing/healing soldiers? How about molotov-cocktail throwers and flame troopers? How about cars rolling into flank you during street/garage fights, filled with dudes ready to light your ass up from the windows? What about that same thing but with MG-mounted jeeps? Or hell, you could even throw in a World War 1 tank if you want to stretch reality a bit. And if you want to stretch it even further via some Steampunk/Fantasy elements, that could add even more options. I wouldn't mind. Fuck historical accuracy if historical accuracy means boring gameplay. Gimmie some Nikolai Tesla steam robots and electricity guns. Give me voodoo zombies (the game already kind of has them) and Deep Ones summoning Cthulhu cultists. Fuck it.\n\nLack of enemy varieties is further hurt by the lack of a destructible environment. Unlike X-Com, Phoenix Point, or any other TBC games I know of, nothing seems to be destructible. Even flimsy wooden crates can take a shotgun blast without so much as a dent. The battlefield remains a static, boring place thanks to this. \n\nYour own boiz do have a degree of diversity, especially when you take into account their traits. However, without a worthy opponent, all that is pretty much wasted. \n\n- Need an element of public relations to the game. PR was fucking huge to real life mobsters. Without the community at least turning a blind eye, you had jack shit. It's why, as the game actually mentions, many of them set up shit like soup kitchens during the Great Depression. There is absolutely none of this in the game that I can see, which is a fucking shame, as it would add a whole new dimension to the game. It would be awesome to have to balance publicly destructive criminal actions (such as things that would negatively affect the local economy) with doing shit for the community like opening up orphanages or the aforementioned soup kitchens. If you play your cards right, you should be the people's hero; have people cheering your name in the streets as you walk by. \n\n- I can't tip the pianist in my speak easies and have them play Rhapsody in Blue like the real life Al Capone would do.

Graphics are fine, has not crashed yet, stable frames, foundations for the game seem like they're there. I recommend EoS but only when on sale. Otherwise, just hold on to your money and hope it gets active support.\n\nFirst of all, some background, I only heard of this game through CallMeKevin and pre-purchased it after seeing Blitz and CMK's sponsored videos on EoS. I liked what I see from the videos. Two other factors that affected my decision to purchase the game were that a.) it was developed my Romero Games (I'm more familiar with John Romero's work) and b.) that it will be published by Paradox Interactive. Knowing Paradox Interactive their games (developed or published by them) tend to have long lasting support and DLC with two already slated to be released in the future. \n\nIn its present state, the game has bugs, mostly found in quests, diplomacy, and combat. The quest bugs are really annoying and game breaking. It's either you can't find the NPC (High Roller Heaven quest) or the mechanics of the quest are broken (breweries remain closed after finishing the quest for Jacques). It needs quite a few quality of life improvements (like a better way to filter properties in your empire and a way to see the day progression maybe a clock or meter). The tutorial is solid enough though I had to figure certain things out myself. The economy and management aspects are pretty easy to understand but makes it feel lackluster. As for combat, it's pretty repetitive and loses its flare after a couple of fights. Diplomacy and interactions with the other factions are bland, making it feel unnecessary. Properties and the map could really do with some changes. It gets repetitive. One thing to note is it hasn't crashed yet, at least.\n\nIt's not all bad. Even if combat is repetitive, it is currently not buggy (the same can't be said for the rest of the game), the existing aspects are decent. Map is big, even if it's repetitive like the combat, a single playthrough could potentially last hours. A decent number of mob bosses to start with (still hoping for custom character creation). Frames are stable for me. \n\nA few things that, in my opinion, could help make the game better, adding more roles and actions you can take as the boss, adding more kinds of businesses, and interactions with local politics (this happens through a quest and ends there). Just my opinion, won't really affect my review.\n\nI enjoy the game but it feels like it's missing a lot of features which I hope get added in free and not tied to DLC. Unfortunately, it feels like a game that could pass up as an early access game. I heard modding tools will be added which will, most likely, make it better off.

They took out some of the OP elements, made the enemies tougher, but this is still a vapid shoot em up pretending to be a sandbox strategy game.  Spend your $50 on a deeper product.  I have switched my recommend to not recommend, as there is too much lacking to make this a full price product released as completed.\n\nAny game that the enemies curse at you when you shoot them is highly recommended.  Fun, addictive, but lacks difficulty and depth.  If you consider the game in beta rather than fully polished it is actually not in that bad of shape.  Most of the bugs and game play issues have been fixed as of patch 1.03, but this kind of game should need longer than a single full day play session to beat, IMO.  Worth a purchase, but probably can wait until it is more polished. If they go the \"DLC to fix the deficiencies\" route I will not follow down that money pit.\n\nPros: Historically accurate, funny dialogue, multiple characters with unique back stories and mission arcs, the interrelationships between all of the gangsters makes for interesting twists (had a love triangle form in my gang and one of the scorned lovers killed my doctor out of jealousy), and the concept of building a gangster empire in prohibition Chicago is a fun environment to play.\n\nCons :Combat is repetitive and easy (boss taking on 6 thugs, no problem), difficulty only exists at the very beginning of the game, the empire management system needs some work, diplomacy is lacking, and not enough depth to the game besides the story.  For a sandbox game, the only fun is had playing the canned missions and not creating an empire. \n\nSummary: This game is intensely fun but gets repetitive. With a game laden with blood, gore, and cursing there should be a much larger challenge.

From my experience from CK3 and other games I would say 3-6 months before the game reaches the level that it should have been at its release right now, so buy it then although it won't be any cheaper.\n\nPI always fixes their games eventually and although they are only publishers on this one I am sure this will be the case here.

By the description it sounded like a game I would fall in love with and sink hundreds of hours into. \"It will be incredibly replayable\" is what was promised. Unfortunately that turned out to be false for several reasons, and so rather than give a pros and cons list I intend to make my review a reason why it lacks replayability.\n\n1.\tEconomy system is shallow. \n\n(Booze->distribution) +Casino(+-rng income)+brothel income=Cash\n\nThese values can be changed in two methods, upgrades or conquering more locations. Due to the time it takes for upgrades and the cost, conquering can be done cheaper and faster and one can almost ignore upgrades altogether. \n\nMoney then has two purposes buy gear or hire gangsters. That\u2019s the entire economic system, so there is no reason to play tall or shift playstyle, as it would not effect gameplay. \n\n2.\tDiplomacy is a bust. There is negligible benefits of playing friendly. The only benefit is maybe nonaggression pacts, however losing rackets doesn\u2019t actually matter, as there is the \u201cenders game\u201d victory condition where when you kill a boss you take all their territory including territory you lost to them. War is always preferable to peace\n \n3.\tLack of gangster customization and variety. Due to the notoriety system, gangsters will always start the same every playthrough. Your starting gangsters are out of 5 so you will play with the same gangsters almost all the time. On top of that their unique perks may affect their combat a little, but play very little role in terms of the campaign map. \n\n4.\tLack of map variety. The hideouts, speakeasys etc are all the same and recycled. It is super repetitive.\n\nThe time period is cool, the musical score is fantastic, but it tries to mix rpg elements, tactical elements and 4x elements, and unfortunately doesn\u2019t make it.\n\nEdit Notes: Felt the need to come back and say its also very buggy.

Buy at a discount, or when they finally allow modding.\n\nit's o.k.\nNot very fleshed out imo..\nI don't see what they did different really here besides the world view being expanded a bit.. but the depth is incredibly lacking. They really could have tied things in better -- always losing track of missions and not able to view multiple mission objectives on-screen at once.. A bit disorganized feeling.. Definitely not worth the price tag I'd say because you can just b-line for the enemy safehouse and just ambush the front guards and move in from there. I've done that my first play-through nearly exclusively with just up to 4 gangsters in my crew. I think a missed opportunity is that even though the AI crew has some 26 gangsters, they don't call them in to help when their territories are getting wasted.. It's all happen-stance, whereas if the AI happens to be around the area, then they get involved in the fight.. What's the point of them having such a large force if I can just knock down 1 little door to a safehouse containing 6 petty guards and the mob boss? Pffft\n\n.. Also, modding was discussed but I don't see any type of option to enable mods, let alone a steam workshop area on the game page as one would normally see... Overall I'm rather disappointed for having pre-purchased the premium. I do recommend the game to anyone looking for a bit of that 'gangsters' vibe. it's not a bad game, just didn't live up to what I was expecting. And I highly suggest waiting for a discount, maybe holiday sale or something.\n\nOverall what could make this better to start with? Aside from the clamoring bugs (standing deals being stuck ongoing even after killing the boss of the mafia you had the deal with), or lacking sense of progression, I suggest devs extend the parlor types you can have --businesses and rackets extend further than just 'brothel' or 'casino' or 'brewery' or 'speakeasy' I mean really, flesh it out and give us more in the realm of depth...

I fall into that second camp and would recommend this game, and there are a few reasons for this.\n\n1. It's fun to run around the streets of 1920's Chicago! The developers did a great job creating a fun atmosphere for this game. If you run right past a car crossing the street to your next objective, the cars will honk at you and generally make a fuss. And I have also noticed that each district has it's own personality, go tot he docks and you'll see Thugs hanging by the docks, and you can almost smell the salt air. But head to the Near South District, where I started, and it's a rabbit warren of tight streets and alleyways, where you can get jumped by a gang if you aren't paying attention.\n\n2. The combat, while maybe not quite as smooth as X-COM's or one of its copies, is still enjoyable, if not very challenging (and something I hope the devs will work on). You can charge in, and with my first boss's ability, blow three guys away on first site, have an almost perfectly clean fight, but still manage to lose someone because you didn't quite pay close enough attention to what that one enemy thug is carrying. (Sorry to my first two gang members, you will be missed).\n\n3. The business side of things, while not very complex, does have some intricacies. If you want to make the most profit for your buck, you need to make sure the distilleries you have are producing the right amount of each kind of alcohol, to meet the demands of the various districts you're working in. Plus, you can manage your buildings to make sure they aren't competing with each other and instead work in harmony. I also love that you can take over a rivals business and decide to either keep it as is, completely wreck the business, or even better, burn it to the ground in true Chicago style. Though I do wish the buildings would actually be shown as ruined husks when wandering the city in street mode (hint hint devs).\n\n4. I've seen some say that the characters are dry, and I would have to disagree. They have life in them! I was wandering in the dockyard district with my crew when all of a sudden there was a spat between three people involving love, relationships, and broken hearts. And one of them even became an alcoholic because of it! The bosses themselves are also fun to interact with, it was great sitting across from Al-Capone and talking smack for a few minutes for getting down to brass tacks and making an uneasy alliance to both grow our empires. Which in the end led to me, a fake Canadian Frenchwoman who moved to Detroit to make a name for herself, contracting out security to Al-Capone to stave off his rivals.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game if any of the above intrigues you, I've played around 6 hours today, and know that I'll be coming back for more. I still have to take over Chicago after all!

The interface could be easier (e.g. keeping your party together is a nightmare), the game is slow as hell (super laggy), and the bugs kill any fun in the game (literally--the game randomly started combat with someone I was working with to double cross). The game keeps bugging out visually. One moment, everything is fine; the next, it's a pixilated horror show or the wall lights are flashing everywhere like it's a 1920s rave. The storyline is interesting, and I like the missions, but this game was no where near ready for publication and Paradox has done their fans a disservice by publishing this before it was anywhere close to being ready. I do not plan on playing this again until a serious patch comes out, and if that does not happen soon I will ask for my money back. I know game development is hard, but this product was simply not ready and it's an extreme letdown thus far.\n\nEDIT: 19 hours later, and the game is still... bad! I mean don't get my wrong, it's mindless and kinda entertaining, but the storylines go no where. For instance, you start out with a quest helping the mayor, and he eventually promotes you to active mayor (this isn't much of a spoiler, it happens within about 10 minutes)... and then nothing. Other quests are bugged out and can't be completed. \n\nThe game is just a grind: you get a ton of rackets, easily take over the rest of the gangs (the mechanic of just killing the leader and then taking over ALL of their rackets is a) unrealistic and b) breaks the game), and the quest lines are generally short and not particularly different/engaging (\"go kill \"thugs\" in X building. Oh, and now I'm going to give you the building! Even though that would have happened anyway!\"). I really can't recommend this game at all. It's just really buggy, repetitive, and broken.

However, there are things I like and things I dislike.  \n\n  \n\nThings I enjoyed: I really enjoy the combat although there comes a point where your squad becomes fairly overpowered in a medium to low difficulty.  \n\nI enjoy the sitdowns a sitdown in the game is an opportunity to strike some kind of a deal with other factions in the game. However, I wish there was more content in that regard but overall I can't complain I think it adds a little flair to the game that I feel is often overlooked.  \n\nI also really enjoyed that they added in missions so it's not just about taking out your rivals and gaining turf. \n\n  \n\nThings that were less then spectacular.  \n\n  \n\nSo I will say the game does have a few bugs I don't think any of them are game breaking however, they do take away from the experience and I hope they patch them, I also feel the AI needs some touching up the AI (at least on the medium difficulty) is way to easy and often times makes some pretty stupid moves if you ask me lol. I wish Diplomacy was a bit more fleshed out as I feel there could be more things you can do with. I also really wish there were more racquets and businesses that you can run as they only offer like 4 so that's kind of a buzz kill.  \n\n  \n\nOverall there are plenty of characters that you can play as which was nice, plenty of secondary characters you can recruit into your squad or kill in combat when taking down your enemies, and I really like that they tried to give each mobster a unique personality.  \n\n  \n\nSo should you get this... yes but I would hold off for a sale 40 bucks is a little steep for this game in my opinion.  \n\n  \n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1606880865, "timestamp_updated": 1606880865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81439068": {"recommendationid": "81439068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124393898", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 178, "last_played": 1607194761}, "language": "english", "review": "While this game is not perfect by any means I am having a great time playing the game.", "timestamp_created": 1606880525, "timestamp_updated": 1606880525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81439066": {"recommendationid": "81439066", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985722163", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1607086858}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good so far, if you treat is as a 1920s Xcom.

How the fuck is Al Capone starting with a afro american man and a mexican woman? It makes no sense for the immersion and I think they should make the gangsters to recruit by nationalities to make it more logicial and credible. This is how the player can immersive himself with the period time and the characters. \nAlso there are black policewomen in 1920... Why rewritting the history? It should be part of the experience to immerse yourself in the time period or in the gang you're playing with. \n\nThey improved some of the HUD of XCOM and thats it.\n\nThere is a lot of positive things to say about the game but I'm disapointed about the repetitive combat at the very beginning and middle of the game...

You get buildings that make cash, you upgrade them to make more cash, so you can upgrade them further, and so on. It's much like one of those cookie clicker games in that regard, where it's basically just a big oven you feed coal over and over and over. There are no upgrade paths with downsides, there aren't any advanced decisions to be made on what you sell to whom at what price, there is barely any supply demand in the game, alcohol is made and magically delivered to where it is sold. The only balance act here is to make sure you produce as much or more as you consume, and then slowly watch your money go up.\n\nThe combat is basically babies very VERY first X-Com. Imagine somebody taking out 75% of the Tech-Tree in X-Com, and instead adding a bunch of Traits that give various bonuses and penalties instead. They are cute on the surface level, but again, there are no mechanics that meaningfully interact with any of it. Talent Trees offer some choice, but are held back by obvious \"correct\" picks on many tiers. Even difficult encounters can be won by slapping everybody into high cover and then waiting for the AI to pile into the room you are covering.\n\nThe game also fails at making you actually feel like a proper Mob Boss. The Boss is, by a very wide margin, the strongest Unit in the game. And thus you are forced to do literally everything yourself right from the get go. Maybe this improves as you get into the mid or late game, but everything is just so boring that I have no desire to find out. I spent 2 hours running around from building to building, doing the exact same combat over and over again, while I slowly watched my money go up. Why can't I delegate stuff?

This game certainly lived up to that for me. Reminded me slightly of the Mafia game trilogy but if it was focused on actually managing your rackets. I'm usually not a big strategy gamer but this was easy enough for me to understand and enjoy. If you want another XCOM game i wouldn't really say that this is for you as the battles are such a small part of the overall gameplay. \nThe tutorial is voiceacted which i really appreciate because sometimes strategy game tutorials can get super longwinded and contain mountains of text before even beginning the game. \n\nSome of the things that need improvement: \nI did have some problems with some of the voice acting as it felt like it ranged alot in quality. Some bosses had great voices while others not so much... \nI feel like there are some balancing issues with some combat abilities but i don't doubt that those will soon be fixed now that the game is released. \nFurthermore some parts of the UI needs a little bit of detail work, some icons look very similar and are hard to tell apart. Factions are color coded which is really hard to see the difference on, would be generally nicer with symbols for each faction instead or something similar. \nAlso the political game against other main factions is not thoroughly explained as sometimes other bosses will request things from you or declare war but at other times you can completely crush them without speaking a word to them. I assume this is not how the game is intended to work and therefore I don't see this as a major problem as long as they adjust it and can present the intended Gang War & Sitdown mechanics. \nWhen you reach late game it becomes quite hard to keep track of all your rackets, it would be great if there would be future possibilities of merging your rackets into larger ones. Even after just taking over one or two neighborhoods it can get rather overwhelming to keep track of it all. \n\nOther than a few bumps here and there I think the game is completely playable without any game breaking bugs. I love how they've presented the setting with the music, art and general vibe. It is a immersive mafia management game without feeling like you're just sitting in front of a spreadsheet just crunching numbers.

There is a strong foundation here, and I have faith the game will reach my expectations some day.\n\nAt this time however, this should be released as early access with clear goals. It does not live up to the game description nor the price tag. Unfortunately, it's really not even close.\n\nReasons to wait:\n1. The AI is awful. There is no competitive or strategic combat here. Enemies will waste a turn unnecessarily running, healing themselves while at full health, or just straight up passing the turn. There are limited environments, limited units (classes), and abilities. Given the small number of combat variables I kinda expected some twist or highly challenging battles.\n2. At it's core, it's bland right now. It's a rinse and repeat. You choose to run around completing missions, with 1 or 2 narrative options that have no in game bearing. You capture rackets (acquire property) to grow the empire and slowly out compete the other gangs. There are 5 rackets, and there are 4ish upgrades to each one, many that repeat from business to business (resulting in a grand total of 15 or so customizations).\n3. Zero narrative and diplomacy. Your dialogue options all lead to the same results (fight or don't fight). Any 'treaties' or diplomacy is static, very small bonuses for agreeing not to attack each other. That's it. No negotiation.\n4. Bugs. I've been trapped, unable to open/close doors and had to reload. I've had rackets/businesses just disappear (if they were captured by someone, where is my alert??). Normally I wouldn't mind reloading my game once in awhile, but to just outright lose part of my empire with no notification is just game breaking for me.\n\nUnderneath all these concerns there is a great game, I really think so.

Hopefully some of this stuff will be fixed in the coming weeks, but right now the game feels like it's early release. There's definitely good bits, i enjoy the freedom to do whatever you want, but at the same time once you figure out the basics, its just rinse and repeat ad nauseum and grind your way to more money and power... if you can. I say if you can, because i keep running into a bug where the interface partially stops working while inside buildings. Your mouse will work on certain things, but not on others (such as leaving the building or talking to people, making you trapped and having to exit the game) or the game will just freeze sometimes in combat, which again, means you have to exit the game. Just to be clear, i am not running this on a potato, i have a pretty decent gaming computer. The characters and building management have potential, especially the whole mobster relationship chart, i really like it, but once you play for an hour, you'e seen most of what the game has to offer. And the worst bit in my opinion is that they're trying to up-sell \"deluxe\" and \"premium\" additions which essentially give you some pay to win toys off the bat and a kill animation that should have been in the game to start, when this game is buggy as hell.

However the combat side is a different kettle of fish, it is I would say a lite version of XCOM, more similar to something like vigilantes, where it is turn based but not as in-depth as XCOM. For me the balance of these two areas works perfectly, I am not going to get bored of being bogged down in long drawn out fights the way XCOM can be and the risk of permadeath for gangsters you have invested a significant amount of time into their development, really adds to the tension at times.\n\nStory/Missions - Having a good time going through some of my gangsters stories and missions as well as the more mainline ones, well-written and quite funny at times.\n\nCons\n\nBugs - For me so far, nothing game breaking or really particularly annoying thankfully. Upon death, people coats tend to instantly change to white. When firing a two handed weapon (Shotgun, rifle, machine gun) even though the AP cost says 1, it ends your turn. I have a feeling these are meant to cost 2 AP as they are noticeably more powerful. (to beat this i just switch to my secondary, fire it off and then switch to main and fire it).\n\nDepth - There's a lot more than you may realise to fine-tuning and optimising your flourishing empire, than is highlighted in the tutorial. You are guided to a certain extent but then left to figure out the intricacies yourself, this may put some people off as it may be a bit daunting for newcomers to the genre.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall I have been pleasantly surprised with this after reading some of the reviews and the poor scores given. I would definitely recommend this as is and it can only get better with future support and DLC!\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1606873293, "timestamp_updated": 1606873293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81434059": {"recommendationid": "81434059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068366169", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "playtime_at_review": 142, "last_played": 1618622956}, "language": "english", "review": "Its alot like a Normal RTS but it has a decent amount of perks which makes it unique.

I obviously didn't see much of it in 70smthg minutes I played but it didn't promise much.\n-No campaign; although it seems like all the bosses have their own stories the game doesn't play like a campaign but a sandbox. I would have loved a storyteller telling the stories of these important mafia bosses.\n-No Auto-Resolve on defense fights! Why? No one would want to pass hours controlling basic characters defending a speakeasy. \n-Although I didn't experience it fully, the business side seemed a bit light.\n-And the biggest no no no THE AI; I have been in fight a few times after the tutorial, and to tell it gently, the AI is bad. On most of the fights the computer chose to move between 2 positions back and forth, without attacking. I was playing on normal difficulty and was expecting a minimum of challenge from the beginning. This game is marketed as a turn-based strategy game, if you failed the AI sorry but you failed the game.\n\nThese are good though;\n-Music; sounded good.\n-City/Neighborhood/Map Graphics; looks pretty although it feels like char animations requires a little more work.\n-Item and char speciality mechanics seemed good, shame that the negatives are so strong.\n\nNotes;\nI didn't get to meet the game destroying bugs but people who played it longer seems to suffer from them.\n\nAlthough the game is maybe 4/10 I wouldn't have try to refund it if you had put one feature in the game; multiplayer. When I quit the game and started to think if I was going to ask for a refund or not there is one question that made me decide; after I finish the game once what will make me play it again? Well the answer seemed to be \"nothing\" for me. Why would I play the same neighborhoods, the same city and the same fights again and again? It seemed to be that it was going to be a one time finish and uninstall. I think whoever took the decision that both the multi and the campaign were not needed, at the same time, should play more games.\n\nAs a gamer who played and loved both Gangsters and Omerta I hope they will fix the negatives and add much more to make me buy it again, then I would happily edit this review and change it to positive.

At this point, I cannot recommend this game in its current state.\n\nFirst and foremost, the bugs and glitches seen within the streaming developer videos were either not fixed or inadequately fixed. Combat is buggy, sometimes causing you to have to restart the level/load a save. For example, even playing the tutorial my combat screen failed to load in so I was just staring at the characters unable to move/shoot or do anything. Playing as Al C. you will inevitably end up firing into the wrong direction with your special without a foreseeable cause, as seen in the developer stream.

There have to be drivable cars... I want to drive by a rival gangs head quarter, shoot them and drive away... \n- bugs, nothing game breaking...\n[EDIT 1] \n- game is way too easy (if you are not outnumbered by 1 to 5+ and/or get screwed over by bad placement): I just skipped the missions and went straight for attacking everything that moves (first thugs, second rival gangs), by the year 1921 I own whole little italy and killed of 4 rival gangs, 3 other gangs are under my protection (not counting the neutral ones), I now have 5 mobsters + my boss. everytime some rival gang goes to war with me, I'm going straight for their headquarter - done.

Mediocre at best. \n\nHuge fan of this type of games, got many title in my library and i was quite excited about this game (while i'm quite scared of paradox's shitty policies) i still bought a full priced pack which includes future expansions. \n\nAfter playing 3 hours, all i can say is it's an inferior version of Omerta: City of Gangsters which released 7 years ago. There are also some elements such as relationship gimmicks in hire section similar to Jagged Alliance. While combat is somewhat extremely simplified version of Wasteland or xcom series.\n\nThings i can give plus about this game: \n+Dialogues are voice acted, \n+Graphics are somewhat decent and you can see your building's development after you upgrade them. It feels good and seems alive. \n+There are RPG elements here and there and also combat is solid while it's very basic (it's both positive and negative for me)\n+Very pleasant musics.\n\nNegative things are: \n-Combat is extremely easy, i played at hardest difficulty and ai feels like zombies instead of gangsters. They're rushing you like bull and extremely easy to kill. \n-Gameplay is repetitive, run x location to talk, raid y establishment to loot, you're more like a mob instead of a boss.\n-Management is bland. There are very few things to upgrade and manage. It feels like they put it there and forget to add some deepness. \n-Economy is total joke. You can raid and gain more money and equipment (to sale) compared to your 5-10 upgraded establishment chain. Money you can earn from you buildings are somewhat minuscule and they required lots of cash to upgrade (then their upkeep also goes up) while you can slap some thugs and get their weapons to sell. I honestly feel more viking than a mobster after 3 hours of constant raiding.   \n-Dialogues are tasteless and pointless while story is uninteresting (maybe it will improve at later stages)\n-Characters are uninteresting. Seriously i was so hyped when i saw many bosses to choose but honestly that's it. \n\nIn brief, it's in infant stage right now. Add to your wishlist and look few more stream or videos to get a feel.

The enemies might be on the complete opposite side with one close to you making the fight incredibly easy.

But as it stands I genuinely feel like I've experienced all the game has to offer which right now doesn't seem to be much. It feels like I'm breezing by killing everyone and everything in my way with no actual strategy needed in attacks, who I ally with or who I make an enemy of - because I can legitimately just squash them all like ants with absolutely zero repercussions, as long as I don't just do it all at the one time. Combat has no difficulty, the AI is absurdly bad and opens itself to easy attacks like they're just begging you to kill them. There's no real strategy in what is supposed to be a strategy game.\n\nThe characters themselves have no personality, which while isn't necessarily important for a strategy game, I feel that if you're going to give us the ability to become friends with and enemies with the other gangsters within Chicago, it might be best to ensure that they all don't feel like the same cardboard cutout with a different paintjob.\n\nNow, this game isn't terrible, it just gets really boring incredibly fast. I just can't recommend it at full price, but on sale? Absolutely. I put hours upon hours into other Paradox Interactive products (mainly Crusader Kings II), so I have faith that they'll eventually get around to adding things to make the game more interesting, so hey maybe even wait until then. \n\nThe idea of the game, being a gangster and building up your empire brick by brick is a good foundation and I really wanted to like it (and I am going to keep playing it, so this review might change!).

This game had some great promise and I was hoping for something that didn't feel like an xcom clone. Sadly I didn't get that.\n\nCombat is very much bog standard safe xcom style all developers seem to mirror. With some very odd decisions for combat. Example: As part of the game enemy gangs will attack your rackets. But the guards you have inside seem to be randomly generated each time. Case in point: I had a speakeasy attacked, the first time round enemies had 3 sawn offs and my guards had 3 revolvers, based on the layout of the location I won. Game crashed so I reloaded to a save before the attack this time my guards have metal pipes and the enemy have 2 revolvers and a shotgun. Hands down I lose very quickly. Reloaded the save again with similar random loadouts. Its just whose been rolled the best kit wins it seems In that case. Similarly hit percentages dont seem to mean much, not sure if its a bug or poor design or something else but the amount of times and enemy snipes you with a shotgun and you miss when your next to them becomes irritating rather than just feeling like bad rng. \n\nThe characters are mildly interesting but not majorly, and are thrown at you so quickly you can't develop any opinion of them really. \n\nThe management side of things is interesting but doesn't feel like there's really enough there to keep it interesting for any length of time.\n\nChanging the difficulty only seemed to give enemies better %chances in hits against my gang rather than changing their playstyle. So for some reasons sawn off shotguns are hitting my guys from across the street while my guy with a rifle at 80% keeps missing which ruins the dynamic of combat. \n\nIf your into xcom this will feel familiar and you may enjoy it, especially if you like the idea of some light management and politics management. But to me I feel there are games that do each area better and are worth more investment and time. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1606862399, "timestamp_updated": 1606862399, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81426512": {"recommendationid": "81426512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008322935", "num_games_owned": 372, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1607214695}, "language": "english", "review": "This is what Omerta should have been.\nSo far, I am having a good time and with 14 different Mob bosses I could sink a few days into this game.\nWell done!\n....and I have not hit a single bug yet so not sure what all that crap was about.\n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1606862378, "timestamp_updated": 1606862378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81426451": {"recommendationid": "81426451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198230481556", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 93, "last_played": 1606861298}, "language": "english", "review": "Disappointed...", "timestamp_created": 1606862305, "timestamp_updated": 1606862305, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81426381": {"recommendationid": "81426381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071384732", "num_games_owned": 428, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 4033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 303, "last_played": 1617722076}, "language": "english", "review": "Good.", "timestamp_created": 1606862216, "timestamp_updated": 1610242306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81426349": {"recommendationid": "81426349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006165471", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32, "last_played": 1606861212}, "language": "english", "review": "Aside from the fact that it's very linear and boring, and basially kindergarden-level for a turn-based RPG, this is a very sign-of-the-times pathetic take on the overhyped minority agenda.\n\nI mean, I knew i'd refund the moment that the choice of 1st two mobsters for my Al Capone  squad was between a black army dude and a hispanic immigrant lady (both of which I was forced to recruit anyway LMFAO). u wot mate?!\n\nWhatever the flip is that, Pradadox?

[/url] [/td] [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nEmpire of Sin is a turn-based strategy and management game with basic RPG elements. \n\nThe turn-based battles are like in many similar games. Your character has 2 AP's and most actions cost 1. Initiative decides in which order characters act. Every character has special abilities you unlock through leveling them up. A basic skill tree lets you decide which ability you want to unlock. To learn the new ability your character needs a few days/weeks. \n\nSo, how are these turn-based battles compared to other games?\nFor 40\u20ac/USD I expected these battles to be deep and tactical. They are not. They are just basic overall. The AI acts stupid and is not dangerous at all. Most battles seem like a joke and even though you get shot and hurt, it doesn't get dangerous. I expect the fights to be a chore later in the game. \nIt's just too easy and nothing compared to the average TBS game (let alone XCOM). This is the most basic and untactical a turn-based strategy game can get.\nAlso, the accuracy of shots seems arbitrary. Standing 2 tiles away from the target, it shows an accuracy of 25%. Moving closer, it shows 56%. Even then: Standing in front of the target and I don't even have an accuracy of 50%? There are countless examples of how absurd the accuracy is overall. It doesn't feel right. Spoiler: Most shoots (mine, not the enemies') hit the target even though I get an accuracy of 26% or something. Even considering the different types of weapons (Shotgun, pistol, machine gun), it's just ridiculous. \n\nStory-wise it's pretty interesting. The voice acting is good enough but nothing special and the writing is okay. The movements of characters in cutscenes are monotonous. Every character has like 2 different movements and most of the time they don't fit to what they say. It seems cheap. Paired with the graphics (which aren't good and also seem like they went for something better but couldn't achieve it and just went with how bad it looks) it looks comically most of the time. \n\nSo, how about the management aspect of the game? \nI didn't play that long yet but it's very detailed and probably the biggest and best aspect of the game. You can do every little thing with your businesses and interact with every other gang.\nYou can go and attack some other gangs, destroy their buildings, take them, or just rob them. You can talk with bosses, negotiate with them, or just ignore them. Diplomacy is the key to a successful business. And then there's also the police. \nEvery boss and all of your characters have their personality. They are loyal to different gangs and have different characteristics. \nThis all seems very good. I did not play long enough to give a final judgment about that part of the game yet but i expect it to be the main attraction of this game. \n\nOverall the game feels very clunky and cheap considering it costs 40USD/\u20ac. I definitely can't recommend it for that price. It's overpriced. Similar games of the genre are WAY cheaper and do it better (TBS games at least). There aren't many games that combine turn-based fights with management like Empire of Sin does but looking at it as a TBS-game (considering at least half of the game consists of that) it's just not good enough. \nWait for a sale. I don't expect them to change the TBS-part of the game. They need to completely revamp it probably. \nEven if you're just (or mainly) into the management part of the game I don't think it's worth full price now. It definitely doesn't have the quality of other games with a price tag like that. \n\n[table]\n\t    [tr] [td] [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38553778-All-about-Strategy-Games/] If you like my review and strategy games, please consider following my curator page on Steam!

It is a mix of Xcom 2 style combat and squad management along with sim game empire management. Instead of flying mission to mission like in Xcom, you play real time in a huge open world. You find missions around the map by hitting up opposing warehouses, bars, brothels, etc. or enter into street shootouts with thugs. There is quite a lot of depth in the character management as each boss and gangster has many traits that make them unique when you start out, and they also acquire traits and skills throughout the game.\n\nThe combat itself can definitely use an \"Autofight\" mechanic as it can get repetitive over time. I hope this is something that comes in a patch. Otherwise, it is your typical turn based combat with abilities, positioning, items, perks, etc., all playing out as you overtake property. \n\nThe empire management is deep enough on the surface and has a lot of facets. You buy different properties and need to manage your alcohol production and distribution. You can enter into deals with opposing gangs for protection, trade, and other stuff. I see a lot of people complaining that despite the many options here that they find this part to be too easy to succeed at by just doing whatever you want and still making money. However, I found it quite challenging to do that when playing on the harder difficulty setting. If you play at the default setting, dont expect a serious challenge...\n\nThere are also RPG mechanics at play as you decide how to deal with other gangs as well as your own henchmen. I havent played enough yet to have a really thorough overview of this, but it looks promising enough so far.\n\nOverall, I am happy with this game even if it does blend all the genres and execute its ideas as perfectly as I had hoped it would. There are already expansion packs in development that will hopefully add depth to the game. A lot of the other issues such as repetition, game balance, and combat AI can hopefully be ironed out with patches (A major day 1 patch is already available). Most people can agree that whether you like it or not, the base is there for a great game to be developed over time. If youre on the fence, perhaps come back in 6 months once some DLC has fleshed out the mechanics and patches have addressed some of the issues.

The characters and mobsters are interesting. I like how the mobsters have personalities, enemies, loves and friends amongst their associates, and bios. Reminds me of Jagged Alliance (Which Brenda Romero, designer of this game, worked on, so it makes sense). \n\nEach Mob Boss has similar spread of talents and bonuses to their empire, so take the one whose personality and looks match your desire. They all have fun personalities and voices.\n\nAs for the strategic layer, it's not super deep, but it isn't boring either. I like taking over my neighborhood, taking out mobsters and enemy crime families.\n\nCombat is typical turn-based X-Com fare. You can buy new weapons and gear to equip your mobsters with and go at it with other mobsters. It's satisfying trapping a mob boss with overwatch and finishing him off with an execution.\n\nIt's not as deep as Gears Tactics, but it's fun, and definitely better than Omerta.\n\nI like the music and presentation most of all.

I think they have a strong vision and that this game could be something great. If this game were $15 or $20 I could easily, happily recommend it.\n\nHowever, it's not great yet, and it's not even a finished product. It absolutely feels like a game in (early, genuine) beta, or early access. It does not feel like a finished product.\n\nIf you enjoy turn based games, you'll probably like this. If you enjoy the aesthetic, you'll probably like this. But at the moment it is just too clunky and wonky for me to recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have excess money. There are far, far better games you can get for this price tag, as much as I'd like to recommend it.\n\nI do think the game will receive polish and be okay. But right now everything from the animations to the graphics to the gameplay just feels really rough.\n\nI want to add a little bit more via edit, so here we go:\n\nThere are two major factors that led to me hitting \"Do not recommend\" instead of \"Recommend\". They are:\n\n1. When entering buildings for combat your mobsters are just randomly placed. Even though each building has a door/proper entrance, you're just randomly teleported, usually into a bad position with little cover. It's very weird and jarring, and I'm not sure if this is a bug or intentional -- why are my mobsters, walking into a racket through the front door, spawning in the back of a brewery?\n\n2. The animations and effects are almost painful. They just aren't there yet -- it makes the game feel so \"beta.\" As a few examples:\n\n- When characters talk, their lips barely move. It's like they didn't even try to sync lips, which leaves me confused why they bothered using 3D models at all. Budget games can absolutely EXCEL using 2d arts and stills, with a little bit of animation, to sell their cinematics, and this is one such game that ought to.\n\n- One of my characters has an ability that's sort of like a berserk. I can't control her on her turn, and she just unloads a full clip into everyone. It's pretty cool! Except the sound effects loop over each other, clip through each other, and the firing effect doesn't match up with the sound at all. It's very grating.\n\n- The combat has no 'oomph.' When I blast three mobsters with a shotgun, I feel like it ought to LOOK like I just one-hit 3 mobsters with a shotgun, y'know? I'm not necessarily talking about gore, just appropriate impact.\n\nAlso, you have no ability to customize your crew. I know this may seem minor, but I'd love to have a variety of outfits, hairstyles, etc. to go through, rather than my boss always looking the same. It's kind of silly, but there's a roleplay element to turn based games that I always enjoy, and the lack of customization prevents me from enjoying that as much as I'd like, particularly because, going in, I was very much looking forward to the roleplay idea of being my own mob boss.\n\nSince this feels very negative, I'd like to share a few Pros of the game:\n\n- It's aesthetically pretty nice.\n\n- The music is stellar.\n\n- It has good bones.", "timestamp_created": 1606856833, "timestamp_updated": 1606862823, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 81, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.779890716075897217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81421037": {"recommendationid": "81421037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029704499", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1606977997}, "language": "english", "review": "So far, enjoying the game play.

Yes, I had some great moments, like when I accidentally started a battle that had 20+ individuals fighting in two separate wars, but then it was bogged down by this games biggest flaw: Its AI. When you are fighting the AI, it's bad, because it makes the game too easy when they just run towards you like orcs and get ground to paste by your overwatch or put in easy positions to be shot. But when the AI fights each other, as happened in that massive street battle that should have been epic, it's deficiencies truly show. Turn after turn, instead of shooting or doing anything helpful, the AI would just run across 3 enemies with a full turn of movement, and what should have been a fast-paced, 5 turn max epic shootout turned into a comical 20 turn display of incompetent AI. The game is close to something good, it really is, but until the AI is fixed, I can't recommend it at any price, let alone $40. \nAnother fix is that I think the boss characters are way OP, and while a relatively fun boss to fight (compared to the standard fodder), I think a more X-com-y system could be better. Keep the bosses sidelined, maybe with a penalty or cooldown or something for using them, and instead focus on the mobsters you hire maybe leading a small group of standard mob. Add an armory and recruiter to the safehouse to gather and improve these mob members, treat them like manpower in a war. I think that would make battles much more interesting, where the player can actually loose something, but also would only work with an improved AI. \n\nI've been watching this game for a while now, and have been pretty excited for it to finally come out. When I first opened the game, I had 2 great hours, admittedly with many QOL improvements desperately needed, but towards the end of that time I started getting bugs that resulted in a hard-lock crash.

You can never call a meeting from behind your desk in your safe house and carefully plan your next move and send out your lieutenants to carry out hits. Everything is the character you pick running full sprint about the map doing same stuff basically. The business management aspects are bland as it can possibly get, and honestly you never at any moment feel you're running a \"empire\" but you will begin to feel a land rush attitude to take turf/new buildings constantly, least enemy get the upper hand. My biggest beef is the playable characters besides a couple aren't interesting at all, everytime you click them they repeat same cheesy phrase. Example Dion will repeat stuff like \"I will be there in 2 shakes of a lambs tail!\" Yeah he is a true gangster, I get shivers just listening to his corny 1 liners. \n\nThe fact we have to use and look at our characters a lot and frankly they're bland. We can't gain outfits nor gear we can see visually change their appearance. Also some characters look as if they've had more TLC like Al Capone, he looks nice with nice strong details on his outfit/face. You can tell time wasn't taken for example Frank Regan whose 1 color outfit looks rushed down to his blurry MS paint tie. Then there's the voice acting or lack there of... its just not good and characters like Reyna are just plain bad with voicing. The dialogue isn't great either and I never felt like at any moment it even mattered, again bland. Its not terrible its just not good.\n\nThe game gives you a list of characters you can hire at a big cost and a cut to your business earnings. They will run with you to fight etc. they're like crew members like in XCOM, but they're premades with small stories, background, traits. A lot have goofy outfits you can never change like a nurses outfit or ww1 style military officer outfit. They don't give gangster nor everyday vibes, they're very cliche. The world seems bland and everything seems like a rehash or a copy same object gives little reason to look at your surroundings because you've seen them all so many times in first hour you don't care anymore... this includes building interiors.\n\nHonestly there's little going for this title beyond 15 hours I'd probably put into it. The game does alot of things, but none of these things are great. If you feel spending $40+ on 10-25 hours worth of content is for you? Go for it, everyone is different.

By the description it sounded like a game I would fall in love with and sink hundreds of hours into. \"It will be incredibly replayable\" is what was promised. Unfortunately that turned out to be false for several reasons, and so rather than give a pros and cons list I intend to make my review a reason why it lacks replayability.\n\n1. Economy system is shallow.\n\n(Booze->distribution) +Casino(+-rng income)+brothel income=Cash\n\nThese values can be changed in two methods, upgrades or conquering more locations. Due to the time it takes for upgrades and the cost, conquering can be done cheaper and faster and one can almost ignore upgrades altogether.\n\nMoney then has two purposes buy gear or hire gangsters. That\u2019s the entire economic system, so there is no reason to play tall or shift playstyle, as it would not effect gameplay.\n\n2. Diplomacy is a bust. There is negligible benefits of playing friendly. The only benefit is maybe nonaggression pacts, however losing rackets doesn\u2019t actually matter, as there is the \u201cenders game\u201d victory condition where when you kill a boss you take all their territory including territory you lost to them. War is always preferable to peace\n\n3. Lack of gangster customization and variety. Due to the notoriety system, gangsters will always start the same every playthrough. Your starting gangsters are out of 5 so you will play with the same gangsters almost all the time. On top of that their unique perks may affect their combat a little, but play very little role in terms of the campaign map.\n\n4. Lack of map variety. The hideouts, speakeasys etc are all the same and recycled. It is super repetitive.\n\nThe time period is cool, the musical score is fantastic, but it tries to mix rpg elements, tactical elements and 4x elements, and unfortunately doesn\u2019t make it.\n\nEdit Notes: Felt the need to come back and say its also very buggy.

The music is a nice ambiance and fitting for the time period: so far a selection of 1920's light jazz and swing music. It just flows in the background and keeps a nice soothing tempo that blends it all together. \n\nThere's a broad selection of 14 bosses to choose from, each with their own quirks and special ability. Though from what I can tell so far it's mostly a style choice since the meat of the game is going to be relatively the same with each as the goal is to \"take over the city\" no matter who you pick. You have some options for customizing the game length, size of the city, number of gangs as your enemy and several difficulty settings. The tutorial seems to have covered all the basics required to learn in about 30 minutes while hinting at more depth to discover through game play.\n\nI can't tell how long the game is overall (yet), and quite frankly it might not matter since you can customize that by altering the city size and number of enemies. I get the feeling it's meant to be a few hours and then do it again with someone else for a different flavor.\n\nOverall, a good first impression. no bugs encountered so far. I'll spend another hour playing and then edit in an update before I hit the 2 hour mark (the max play time before you can refund if things go wrong)\n----------------------------\n\nEDIT 1 hour later: There's more depth here than it first appears and it's a playstyle that's a unique blend. You rule your empire and explore the city in real time, everything around you is going on while you make your decisions and wander the streets with your squad. The other factions are busy interacting with each other and as you encounter them you can choose to negotiate or attack. The game only slows down for combat and once you engage it seamlessly transitions into turn based tactical choices with each character going in order of initiative. It's not \"your turn / their turn\" and if more than one faction is nearby other gangsters can enter the fight as your enemy or ally.\n\nIn the last hour I've taken over a speakeasy and a brewery then killed the boss of that faction so he can't retaliate. Bought an abandoned building and turned it into a casino. Then negotiated peace with two other factions while they agreed to give me parts of their enemies territories if I helped them with their gang wars. Making friends and enemies as casually as sipping a brandy.\n\nThere's a surreal quality to the calm undertones of running an empire while jumping in and out of brutal street warfare, curb stomping an enemy to prove a point while making business decisions with your next breath as you expand through either negotiations or combat on the whims of wherever your heart takes you.\n\nI don't want to gush with praise too much as it's still pretty early in the game, but so far it's a casual blend of tycoon management with a light layer of RPG conversations and humorously over-stylized combat.\n\nI'm not refunding this and the $40 asking price for the game is worth the money to me. I'll edit this again after I've put some real hours into it.\n----------------------\n\nEDIT 20 hours later: The game has some flaws, there are numerous graphics bugs and some quirky design choices, but at least for me it's been nothing game breaking. (I can see some other people having issues)\n\nI would note: When I installed this I also had to reboot to install some windows module that came with it, I do wonder how many people ignored the windows update. But I can only speak from my own experience.\n\nThe gameplay doesn't change much beyond the first couple hours other than a little more management options as you get more notoriety and some variables in mobster side stories and combat options as you recruit a few more of them. But then you could say that about most games. In response to people whining that: you just keep doing the same things; yea and? \n\nShooters: you go from area to area shooting people. We could be talking about Chess: OMG you just keep moving the pieces around!\n\nIf you just want to boil a game down to it's core gameplay loop all of them are repetitive, it's a question of whether you enjoy that loop or not.\n\nThis isn't a big AAA game from a studio with 100's of people working on it. It's a small indy game that just wanted to create a stylish tycoon game with a 1920's prohibition theme. So much of the hate thrown at this game comes from people who created their own expectations or have no concept of the actual time period this is set in.\n\nFor those having a worse time with bugs than me: the devs have been very active in collecting reports and working on solutions, but again I can't comment on things that aren't effecting me and what I've seen have been minor.\n\nI've been playing quite a bit these last few days and reading the forums and other reviews. I really don't understand the hate, there appears to be a concentrated effort from trolls to just aggressively attack this game, often with made up lies. I've seen complaints about microtransactions (there aren't any) or nonstop whining that it doesn't match certain gangster movies\u2026 that are set in other time periods\u2026 and the list goes on.\n\nEvery time I think about whether I should revise my review I just have to ask myself one question: Am I having fun? And the answer is still yes. And that's all I really ask for from a game to recommend it, give me some fun and entertainment for my money.\n\nI'm not saying the game can't be improved, but that will just make it even better in the long run. In the mean time I'm still enjoying it, warts and all.\n---\n\nBottom line: It's a $40 indy game that has very casual tycoon management, a light RPG story layer and a minimalist tactical combat approach that reminds me of Mutant Year Zero (which was itself an XCOM variant but with free roam/ambush mechanics)\n\nI guess I just don't expect a game to be perfect, I just want it to be fun and I'm still enjoying this quite a bit.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1606848371, "timestamp_updated": 1608670250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530536830425262451", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81412837": {"recommendationid": "81412837", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962326676", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1617611099}, "language": "english", "review": "XCOM but the Aliens are Italian", "timestamp_created": 1606848242, "timestamp_updated": 1606848242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 194, "votes_funny": 541, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646969020366668701", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81412738": {"recommendationid": "81412738", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079115888", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 62, "last_played": 1606847782}, "language": "english", "review": "I had high hopes.

What you are doing at any given moment is driven by what you, as a player believes is important. The game provides some suggestions, in the form of a robust quest system, but it is ultimately you that is pushing towards achieving your overall goal: becoming the kingpin of Chicago. There are three major aspects that you will be managing in pursuit of this: your criminal empire, combat, and relationships with other factions. \n\nThe biggest flaw is that the game feels more competent than truly special. All of the systems are very functional and effective and generally fun, but they play it a little bit too safe. Class abilities are very similar to what you would expect for a close X-Com 2 spin off, and some appear to essentially have been copied from X-Com 2. The diplomatic system feels like Europa Universalis IV with a bit of a mobster spin, and the economic system is functional but not really surprising or exciting in any way. Maybe it is too much to expect from a Paradox title, but I would have preferred some more risks or attempts to stand out. Instead it is functional and fun, but not exceptional.\n\nEmpire of Sin is fun. You are constantly given interesting stuff to do, and the fact that they have set up an almost simulation-style world that progresses and changes even without your active intervention is something I haven\u2019t really seen in a game focused as much as this one on tactical turn-based combat. Nothing really pops out as particularly new, but it is engaging and the game had no problem maintaining my interest for extended sessions. Everything fits together very well in a seamless sort of way that shows a lot of care from the design and conceptualization side of things.  \n\nEmpire of Sin is a good game and if the idea of playing a game where you are a mob boss, fighting in the streets of Chicago for dominance while being heavily involved in the diplomatic, economic, and tactical aspects of these fights appeals to you then I can definitely recommend it. Unfortunately, the reviewer copy included some pretty unfortunate bugs that were frustrating enough that I was not able to play the game as comprehensively as I would have liked, but I am looking forward to these bugs being squashed so I can truly explore some of the finer points of strategy in Empire of Sin. \n\nPros\n[list]\n[*]One of the most impressive and innovative interfaces I have seen\n[*]Interlocking parts work very well together in a way that is smooth and elegant\n[*]Great style, with fun music, distinct neighborhoods, and nice historical touches\n[/list]\nCons\n[list]\n[*]Combat is a bit loose with unthematic optimal actions and exploits that should have been fixed\n[*]Low degree of variety in enemy types can result in combat getting a bit dull as the game continues\n[*]Nothing truly innovative from a mechanical sense. If the game was pushed just a little more it might have stood out as exceptional rather than just good to very good \n[*]Game features a number of extremely frustrating bugs on release. \n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1606844419, "timestamp_updated": 1606867489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 105, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594131708145141602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "81404970": {"recommendationid": "81404970", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994686358", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1606841926}, "language": "english", "review": "It's just fundamentally not a very fun game.\n\nPicked it up hoping for a rebirthing of \"Gangsters\" by Hothouse Creations from the late 1990's; ended up getting X-Com with static characters.

There's not much variety in either the locations or the units used to create the many many fights your crew will get into over the course of a game. The ambush mechanic on the street mostly makes fights too easy if you choose to use it.\n\nLooking through the individual gangsters to find the right fit for what your boss needs has some entertainment to it, but the different tiers of those gangsters seems largely arbitrary. Yes the higher tier options typically have higher stats but their traits often make them a worse choice anyway, or a lower tier a better choice. The need to locate or earn the trust of their friends before you can recruit them starts out as a charming aspect but will quickly frustrate you as you're repeatedly only given the same options despite different actions.\n\nThe randomized events that happen throughout the game are repetitive due to lack of variety and can be significant. You're given choices but lack the ability to review your contributing stats, which change and seem to have modifiers that are either invisible or tough to locate. An example might be given 3 options, one of which requires a monetary investment, one requires having a specific trait (and so may not be available at all if you don't have it), or performing a skill check. Your boss's skills can pretty quickly reach over 100 so it would be natural to assume success, but fails do still happen on those checks.\n\nAll of the above could be tolerated and I've been playing the game despite those factors. What I can't excuse, though, are the situations where the game stops working as intended. Bugs that either force you to reload a previous save: combat bugs where something happens to trigger a character out of turn which then makes them need to act without actually being able to act, so you're stuck on a turn that you can't end. Or a racket becoming such that you can't attack it and so end up with a minor faction that just never expires because one of their rackets can't be attacked.\n\nI've spent probably 15 to 20 hours on the current game I'm in, there's still plenty to do but it's all the same at this point and I've already hit bugs that would make winning, whatever that looks like, likely impossible I don't see the reason to keep going. The other 40ish hours of play time were spent wrapping my head around getting my empire to work properly with the strange economy of the game.\n\nI can't recommend a game that seems like it won't let you finish it due to bugs that have occurred in any game I've gotten more than 5 hours into.", "timestamp_created": 1620501112, "timestamp_updated": 1620501112, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "91613320": {"recommendationid": "91613320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274246997", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 1116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1116, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1620769330}, "language": "english", "review": "Where's Vito?", "timestamp_created": 1620427945, "timestamp_updated": 1620427945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.119281046092510223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "91590552": {"recommendationid": "91590552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176030527", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3911, "playtime_at_review": 7179, "last_played": 1621000064}, "language": "english", "review": "This is basically 2013 \"Omerta : City of Gangsters\" on 2021 steroid.\n\nIf you love Omerta you'll love this game.\n\nRomero added something very important: The inter-neighborhood economy, BUT... they fucked up this really bad.

Add the ability to bribe rival gangsters to join you and even take out their bosses ... the game can be expanded in so many directions and Paradox know how.\n\nA really enjoyable title so far and well worth what I paid for it ... waging gang wars is fun ... assassination missions are suitably tough with plenty of enemies to kill.\n\nOverall, I love it so far.

A time when feminism meant lots of women in the police force and as guards in major gangs. A time when homosexuality was so widely accepted, anyone could develop a gay romance with anyone and loudly proclaim it to everyone they know. A time when the police didn't even need to be bribed to do nothing, the faction exists in game pretty much for show. Gangs all embraced diversity, black gangs hiring plenty of white gangsters and white gangs doing the same with black gangsters. A time when Italians, Irishmen, Chinese, and more all lived in perfect harmony to loot Chicago without prejudice and the only issue with moving outside of your neighborhood was the other, very diverse gangs feeling threatened by the competition. \n\nJokes aside, this is actually a pretty fun game for what it is, and the issues are things that are easily patchable, such as AI behaviors and balance issues. The key is not to expect any evidence that it was \"heavily researched,\" there's none to be found despite the advertising. This game bears zero resemblance to history, and I don't expect that to change based on the fact that the devs actively implemented mechanics that make it less historical to \"represent\" diversity without also representing the uphill battle that would have come with it in the 1920s. Much of the advertising about \"history\" is not to be taken seriously. \n\nA quick rundown of issues that should be easy enough to patch:\n-Mid and late game snowballing is insane. The game is basically over by the early mid or late early game. \n-AI is pretty non-aggressive when it comes to expansion into low-difficulty thug rackets\n-Trading is pretty exploitable, especially weapons because many weapons are overpriced\n-Necessity of regular combat is somewhat grindy\n\nSome things that are really fun:\n+Early game: at higher difficulty levels, you really do feel the pressure of multiple, much more powerful gangs nearby. You need to expand without becoming a threat\n+AI is not afraid to war with you or each other if they have the upper hand and see the target as easier to attack than befriend\n+The strategic side of combat feels good: the neighborhood and taxi system makes it feel like a gang war, where the \"front\" is all around you and you could get hit from any direction. \n+The extent to which this game is ahistorical is honestly almost amusing. Serious meme potential. I won't deny it does have some charm, if you come into it expecting it.\n\nAs far as the tactical combat, it is satisfactory. I won't put it down as a particular highlight of the game, but it isn't disappointing either. \n\nUltimately, I suggest one shouldn't come into this game with any particular expectations, and I think most will find the experience pleasant overall. That said, refusing to buy simply based on how wildly different from what was advertised is reasonable as well. To suggest this game was \"researched\" at all is a joke, mostly just memes and maybe 2 or 3 somewhat lesser known real gangs.", "timestamp_created": 1619545957, "timestamp_updated": 1619648560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51086956262588501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "90930340": {"recommendationid": "90930340", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990951542", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1262, "last_played": 1619402295}, "language": "english", "review": "My word, I did not want to write what follows.
