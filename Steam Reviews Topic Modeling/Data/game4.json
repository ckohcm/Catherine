Sadly the AI doesn't have a sense of when you're nearing victory, so when it should be going all-out to try and stop you from activating a doomsday weapon or preventing you from takings its capitol, it'll still be sending disorganized armies to fight pointless skirmishes.

The research tree is a better system.\n* Mods add diversity to your armies and genuinely keep your weaker units relevant all the way into the late game.\n* Splitting the map up into sectors makes for easier city placement and expansion. No longer do you have to debate whether to found a city next to some high-value resource that will [i]only[/i] have that resource in its domain.\n* The NPC factions are interesting and the \"courting independents\" feature of the game is more developed and fun than it was in AoW 3.\n* The AI is better than it was in AoW 3, especially on the strategic map. The AI will invade if it sees an opening, and it will bypass your fortified cities to go harass your weaker cities.\n* Empire mode is a cool idea.\n* You can save in the middle of tactical combat now. Thank you!!\n\n[b]The Bad[/b]\n\n* The campaign left so much to be desired, especially the DLC \"campaigns\" that are only two missions long. I was so disappointed that they didn't include handcrafted maps for the campaign but instead relied on the random map generator.\n\n[b]The Other[/b]\n\n* Be sure to prioritize energy! Coming from AoW 3, it took me a few games to get used to the fact that energy is both your gold and your \"mana\" in the sense that you spend energy on units and on operations.\n* Although mods help greatly in keeping weaker units relevant throughout the game, they overcompensate in a way that leaves higher-tier units feeling underpowered. In AoW 3, Tier 3 and Tier 4 units were the undisputed kings of the battlefield with Tier 1-2 units being little more than fodder by the late game. In Planetfall, it takes a long time to get to your Tier 3-4 units because you'll be spending research on mods, and by the time you do get to your elite units, they don't feel like the game changers they used to be when going up against swarms of low-level units with endgame mods.\n\nThe good aspects of this game far outweigh the bad aspects.

This is a grand campaign, hexagon based game. When battle is eminent, you can manually play the mission and be presented with an XCOM style turn based battle system. This is quite the gameplay combination. I am a fan of both game series and it is nice to essentially get both games in one package.\n\nThe amount of content is extraordinary. There are dozens of different commanders to choose from, a good number of different factions and an endless supply of maps due to randomisation. There are some campaign missions that will assist you with learning the ropes with multiple factions. \n\nThe audio design is well put together with great background music that does not get tedious, respectable voice acting and nice sound effects. Blasters feel meaty, acid weapons hiss through your speakers and laser attacks create vibrations through your subwoofer you can actually feel.\n\nThis is one of those games that will take you quite a few hours to get through the entire thing. Thanks to its replayability, you might not even have to worry about the DLC. I have no opinion on the DLC since I do not own them.\n\nMy only complaint with the game that is worth mentioning is that the tech tree feels a little like an afterthought.

It didn't grab me from the beginning the same way as AoW3 did so I kind of bounced off it the first couple times I tried to play it. I can't put my finger quite on why that was though, it certainly has more depth than AoW3 and the graphics although not as colourful as the previous title are still nicely done. \n\nHowever after a break from the game for a while I recently got back to trying it out after the latest DLC and the Galactic Campaign Mode were added. I just finished up a game playing as an Amazon Warrior (Princess) who won the game by releasing a doomsday device that infected the whole planet with an Alpha Strain Xenoplague infestation. Lets just say the world had a very green tint to it by the end of the game. \n\nBelow is an overview of how that game went:\n\nI tried to master the planet in quite a few different ways when I started, there was a timed quest to eliminate a single npc faction within 20 turns (I wasn't fast enough). So next I tried to focus on uniting all the 6 factions and going for a Unification victory, however there were 3 Dvar factions that decided they would all become friends and try and take out the rest of us. So it turned out to be a 3 vs 3 duel, however the Dvar factions had all gotten a technological head start on me due to me faffing around doing diplomacy things rather than researching bigger guns or more lethal biomass weapon mods.\n\nNow normally there isn't really much hope of coming back from this situation in a lot of 4X games. However I looked through this list of possible win scenarios and spotted the Doomsday scenario. So I thought what the heck I'll try anything to get rid of these pesky scheming Dvar guys. It took a lot of guerrilla hit and run attacks then quickly hiding in forests but I kept them at bay long enough to start building up my research. Luckily my fellow allies were just about holding their own too so we kept control of the top half of the map just long enough to get the Alpha Strain option on the table. \n\nAlas once I'd set the doomsday chain of events in motion I then had to defend the Strain \"Nodes\" from being attacked for 10 turns. It was really nail biting watching the Dvar heading towards me in their tanks and flame throwing mechs. However I called on my allies to come and help defend and sure enough one of them sent over some troops which didn't quite swing the battle, but was enough to keep the Nodes safe long enough for the Alpha Strain to infect and dissolve those dastardly Dvar. I loved every minute of it. \n\nOf course this is just one example of what could happen and there are so many different ways to customise, that no two games will ever be the same. \n\nAlso special mention to the character editor, wow... you can create just about any character you can imagine, and pick their skills and attributes. The customisation continues through the game when playing too so you really get a sense of advancing as the game plays out. Also the random world events (which came in the Invasions DLC) really help keep things spicy. Just remember there is about a 2-3 hour learning curve to fully get down with it,.\n\nSo if any of the above sounds like fun to you then go for it. It even has multiplayer if that's your thing.\n\nOh yeah one more thing it also has Tyrannosaurs in it.....

Well that did not come as quick as I expected (though it would be just reskin, which would have been ok by me), but it is a bit more than that, is somewhat more involved, and took some learning (was a tad bit annoyed at first; the grand strategy-esque sector stuff, was not a fan of, thought it'd be like in stellaris, but is simpler and thus better here). But after I got used to stuff/learned the ropes, well it is now best non niche TBS for me.\n\nProper tech tree is an improvement on AOW3 system (well, mostly, AOW3 randomness has it's charm too, and as a model of scientific progress maybe kinda more accurate with it being more random and not seeing future as clearly as in tech tree based systems); Mods, well mods are frickin awesome! Probably one of the strongest improvements over AOW3. \n\nFancier city building - good, very good. While I also have quite some fond memories from civ (3rd mostly, and freeciv) I find civs \"city management\" overly \"micro demanding\" and tedious, AOW3 had it much simpler, heroes like (while being just better than any heroes game IMO), but still possibly a tad bit too simple. Planetfall striges nice balance in my opinion, more extensive than AOW3/heroes, not as tideous as Civ. Also expand sector to get roads nukes road micro quite nicely; admittedly it potentially looses some tactical/strategic option from free build of roads, but I think it is a reasonable sacrifice to make.\n\nA word on AI, well in battle/auto-battles, seems somehow it can be significantly worse than human player (but given the complexities that's understandable). While battles are one of main draws of game like AOW/heroes, they can get tedious, and one wants to leave a lot of it to auto-battling, but that is only viable if one has quite strong force advantage. Some games auto vs manual difference is just funky - complete loss vs not a single unit lost. But oh well :)\n\nThere is one very unsatisfactory thing about Planetfal though, that not many will care about: no Linux version, being Linux user and AOW3 being so great and having native Linux, I was ready to take Planetfall full price day one (probably would have been first game where I'd do such thing) if it were to have native Linux. Well it didn't so I waited more than a year and decent discount. Still works well enough thanks to Valve's effort with steam play.

After playing just over 48 hours of this title, I\u2019ve completed 2 conquest matches. And while I was reluctant to write a review about this game after only a couple of in-game bouts. I think that this alone speaks for itself. There are only 3 things that you should consider about this game \u2013 Paradox\u2019s attempt to compete with Firaxis\u2019s Civilization series, Triumph\u2019s attempt to replicate Firaxis\u2019s XCOM combat, and the overall pacing of the game\u2019s mechanics.\n\nParadox stepped in to provide a new angle for this game over Age Of Wonders III \u2013 they seem to have brought a great amount of production value to the table and have applied a lot of lessons that they learned during their development of Stellaris. However, there are a couple of things that this game does differently from all previous titles. It\u2019s a lot more streamlined and approachable than Civ or Stellaris \u2013 but it\u2019s also a lot less balanced \u2013 and a lot less rewarding. On one hand, you don\u2019t have to worry so much about micromanagement, but on the other, you have little to look forward to on the world map other than quitting the game to buy Paradox\u2019s legendarily overpriced \u2018essential\u2019 DLCs. While not as half-baked as AOW3\u2019s mechanics, it\u2019s not nearly fleshed out enough to give towns their own unique identities through the gauntlets of direct upgrades that take huge chunks of the game to develop fully. While, thankfully, there aren\u2019t strict penalties to spreading your empire out, or having big armies \u2013 making this a lot less restrictive, and there\u2019s a lot more things to keep the game interesting, it\u2019s an unfortunate truth that it adds little overall value to the game in general.\n\nTriumph tried their hand at combat\u2026 again\u2026 and it seems to be a lot like last time. There are half a billion unique opponent types and troops to put into your armies. But balance is still something that the developers only heard of in passing, balance is an elusive prospect from early game to end game. Fighting enemies at end-game is a complete gamble\u2026 you can fight the same combat scenario dozen times and it will play out RADICALLY different during each one. Some units are more valuable than others \u2013 some abilities are better than others. And the AI is not much better than in AO3 either. In comparison to refined, well designed, tightly focused TBS games \u2013 it pales in comparison. And a lot of little oversights (Like moving one unit as the other one moves) cause this game to become a slog, with combat encounters that should be trivial taking several minutes to gruel through.\n\nWhich brings us to the final portion of the game: the pacing. While Civ V and VI can have some slow pacing at times \u2013 it\u2019s because there\u2019s a lot going on between each player and faction. And much like Civ, time can pass like no other while playing this game, but not because it\u2019s specifically interesting, but because the mechanics make the long spaces between interesting actions as languid as they can be. After spending so much time on the game \u2013 I can absolutely say that it was not at all worth it.\n\nTL;DR\n5/10\nAge Of Wonders: Planetfall is as Average as a game can get.\nIn spite of some very daring improvements over the previous title, the game itself is a rusted chain connecting anticlimax to anticlimax.

Each race gets its own mini campaign. These campaigns essentially are glorified tutorials, but they're nevertheless very entertaining. Each one teaches you a different facet of the game. I like the new streamlined sector system, which is a lot less fiddly compared to AoW3 (Age of Wonders 3). The tactical combat also got several tweaks; it's more cover based and units can miss their attacks. I do believe it's a bit deeper compared to AoW3, but just as engaging. The unit mod system is just icing on the cake. This system delivers some creative and seemingly OP combinations! :)\n\nTo top it up Planetfall boasts good graphics for a strategy game and the musical score of Michiel van den Bosch always is a pleasure to listen to. I recommend getting all the DLC pieces, as these seamlessly add more races, gameplay elements and variation. The last patch (2020) adds Galactic Empire gameplay mode, a sort of galactic stratego.  This mode brings some macro strategic elements to the table, as winning a planet (map) earns you bonuses to wield on the next planet. Newly created planets get progressively harder to conquer. I only played Galactic eRpire for a short while, but it seems very interesting. I'll certainly try this mode more in the future.\n\nPlanetfall is Triumph Studio's first foray into science fiction strategy, but I believe they achieved their goals with this release. It's a fun, balanced turn based strategy game, with a clear focus on tactical battles. At the core it's actually not that different from AoW3, but still different enough to not be confused as a reskin. In a sense Triuph Studio's newest release is an evolution, not a revolution.

Unfortunatly, it remains quite dissapointing, as I have found out after I came back to the game and more or less ran into the exact same issues as when I binge played it when it originally came out. Even worse still the price tags for the DLC are utterly aggregious, DLC's whose content shouldve been in the base game. To keep this short Ill list the issues and try to keep thier explainations brief below.\n\n1. Empire building; There is close to no nuance whatsoever, buildings provide static bonus's, typically only one, two if its advanced. City placement matters about as far as what resources are available or hazards are apparent, almost all of your cities will be near identical, save for a few options that let you crank out more of a specific resource. If you weren't getting notifications of things being completed you would not even notice it anything changing. All in all, dull doesnt even begin to describe it, as it ends up being a nuisance to manage.\n\n2. Combat; It is to put it bluntly, a AOE spam nightmare, any kind of fun you could have strategizing is lost as soon as you get past around turn 25-30. More or less the AI of the maurader type enemies share the same AI as the \"players\". Thus prioritizing sniping off your units even at the detriment of thier own, making them rather predicatable. Tactical operations range from useful to nigh worthless, anything that forces you to clump up your units to be effect becomes worthless as with the amount of aoe in the game you will get punished; HARD, if you even attempt it. Eventually your brain will glaze over and stop caring as every single battle more or less goes about the same way. Dissapointing to say the least.\n\n3. Balancing, now I will say right now that I do not own any of the DLC's so I dont know anything about them, but as in the base game. There are serious issues plagueing every aspect within. Once you get access to a higher unit tier, there is no point in building weaker units, a single tier III unit will easily wipe the floor with a entire army of single tier units. More or less youll reach a point where you spam one specific unit across all your armies. Speaking of spam, unit spamming is really the only way to get anywhere in the game, abandon all attachment to your armys/heros, and simply build army after army of the same unit and role over everything. Of course you dont have to, but if you dont, then the AI will, by turn 25 its not too uncommon even on normal difficulty to face a AI with 6 full unit stacks. Of which they will mostly be the same save for hero's. Also ally with the paragons, the other dwellings are terrrible compared to the overpowered mods you can get from them.\n\nI could go on further but for the sake of not wasting everyones time more then I have already Ill sum things up, planetfall is a dull carbon copy of age of wonders three without any of the fantasy vibes. Is it a bad game? no, not by any strech of the imagination, its not too buggy either. But when you get down to it the game is nothing but a core gameplay loop of the XXX genre.

I am a huge fan of Civilization 6, and had been struggling to find something with similar mechanics and gameplay, except with a sci-fi setting. If you are looking for that, trust me, you have found it!\n\nThis game is huge, and fairly accessible considering all the complex mechanics. Granted, it really helps if you are familiar with the Civilization series, as that is obviously their main influence with the core 4X mechanics. Battles, on the other hand, are heavily inspired by X-Com and X-Com 2. This adds a new level of tactical nuance and sense of tension and excitement to the gameplay. I also love the fact you can do \"auto-battle\", which is more or less the same combat mechanics from Civ 6, pitting your units against each other based on the strength of your army (albeit it's all done in one turn), and you can view the replays and learn a lot about successful tactics, or you can retry the whole battle with manual tactics if you lose with the simulated auto-combat. \n\nThe game is more fast paced than Civ 6, and not quite as polished as far as Diplomacy and Research, but it's really a TON of fun, and still very deep and complex. The factions are all unique, and often hilarious. Each race and commander has their own perks, quirks, and skills to implement as you play. I've played the tutorial mission and done the \"practice world\" about 7 times, just experimenting with different commanders and races, and each time you'll uncover something new. I've been playing 22 hours so far, and I have honestly barely scratched the surface, like I said, I am only on the \"practice\" world haha, but I am thoroughly enjoying this game. \n\nThe graphics are great and I have had absolutely zero technical issues with the game. It's very solid and smooth. It can be a really relaxing experience, or an intense and engaging one, it all depends on how you prefer to play!\n\nHighly recommended, the best Sci-fi 4X game I've played to date.

The game does feel like an Age of Wonders 4, which takes refines the experience and gives you reasons to keep coming back. Something AoW3 lacked.\n\nQ: Do you enjoy the game and intend to play more of it?\nA: Yes. At first the game feels like it is lacking features, and it can be surprisingly overwhelming with all of the stuff coming at you in the early turns. But as long as you pay attention, read, and experiment with features \u2013 you\u2019ll begin to see the depth hidden beneath the surface. The more I played it, the more I took out of the game and enjoyed it. But it has flaws, like predictable AI and game flow not designed to go beyond 100 turns.\n\n---\n\nSome Notable Gripes\n\nThere is a lot of good in this game, and I\u2019ll cover that soon enough. But let\u2019s first point out some of the flaws so you\u2019d know what you\u2019d be getting in to. First of all the game doesn\u2019t do a very good job explaining itself via the tutorial. Sure it has a tutorial, but it\u2019s a \u2018Baby\u2019s First 4X\u2019 game sort of stuff, literally covering the absolute basics of any 4X ever, as though it was the first of its kind.\n\nAll of the advanced nuance that is unique to this game is relegated to the portions you have to read, and that means there is a great deal of reading. By default, your city can only get a maximum of five sectors, meaning it can capture four more as the starting sector counts as one. You can only build one exploit structure per sector, so choose wisely.\n\nBut by building a Residential District as an exploit, you can gain one additional sector. You can build two Residential Districts max, expanding your total number of sectors of seven. This is a fundamental, basic, thing that all cities pretty much have to do to be extremely effective. Only 2.2% of total players who have ever owned and played the game have actually done this.\n\nSo yeah, the game has a lot of stuff, but YOU need to actually LEARN how to play it yourself. It\u2019s not going to hold your hand and tell you want to do, which may be very frustrating for a lot of people. Understanding how to build properly, divert food resources, and manipulate the AI via a small handful of specific resources are critical to success. And this where the fun resides, but all of that is not obvious and you need to really fiddle with the game a while before things start to click.\n\n Another gripe is that the AI isn\u2019t what you\u2019d hope for in a 4X game. It thinks too hard, but achieves very little over all. Let me illustrate. I created a massive game with several AI, and I made one my ally. We shared vision, relay portals, intel, everything, etc. You can even give them orders to attack a specific target \u2013 but with caveats.\n\nI had a huge, massive, 100+ sector empire and this AI had only a handful of cities. He was practically a vessel, but lord forbid asking the AI to be a vessel is impossible. You can ONLY convert an AI to a vessel when they are on death\u2019s door, and you\u2019re the one beating their face in with said door. There is no other way. Period. I\u2019ve tried!\n\nAnyway, you can give them orders to attack another AI. But doing so will not actually make the AI attack independently. The AI will only attack a target you call, IF you are also attacking that target too. You are always meant to be the the AI\u2019s meat shield, not the other way around.\n\nAnd the AI will never, ever ever put itself in a position where it is your meat shield. It will always retreat and make sure your armies do all the dirty work, then they mop up the stragglers and claim the cities you worked your ass off to claim. So AIs have limits. It will always have massive armies at your border, even if you\u2019re its ally. Because someone apparently programed the AI to always be prepared for the eventuality to defend against YOU.\n\nSo you cannot send the AI to fight another AI, and then you sweep in behind and claim his stuff. No, the AI is ready for this as they have way way way more units than they actually need, just sitting there, on the map, never doing anything other than being ready to fend you off.\n\nGames that exceed 100 turns get bogged down considerably because of this crap, and eventually AI turns take longer than you own, leaving you waiting and waiting for 10 to 15 minutes for the AI to get done computing, because it\u2019s trying to defend itself from everyone, especially you, at all times, at every front, with way way way too many units.\n\nThis is why the score screen is always impossibly off. You can technically have more military might, progress, development, and everything better than the AI \u2013 but you\u2019ll always be listed as last or next to last place. Because the AI doesn\u2019t measure might in actual unit strength, it measures it in units produced. So the AI cranks out hundreds of crappy little units it doesn\u2019t have to pay upkeep for, and stacks every city they own with a notable army of several groups.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t move these units as groups. It moves them all, one by one, unit by unit, on at a time\u2026 So for the love of god turn off walking animations or you\u2019re going to be waiting for the AI for about 30 minutes in games that exceed 100 turns.\n\nThe Good Stuff\n\nGames can be small quick, pop in and pop out. Empire Mode makes this rewarding as you can eventually put together your own strange collection of units from every faction, including the NPC ones. And the NPC factions are extremely important too, but they only compliment certain races. You need to learn with NPC factions compliment you best, work with them, and then just kill off the others so your opponents cannot profit from them.\n\nEmpire Mode is really where the game does shine and it\u2019s worth it for that alone, but it\u2019s a very long grind before you start squeezing some fun out of it too. So keep your games short, quick and dirty, and you\u2019ll have a better time. I\u2019ve tried long games, and eventually the AI became some damn cumbersome that it was clear they were more trouble than they were worth!\n\nIf you have a lot of AI, just make it a point to play nice-nice with um until you finally kill them all mercilessly one by one, as fast as you can as to not bog down the system last game. The more AI that are dead, the faster game goes! Don\u2019t ever put down tons of AI or you\u2019ll regret it. So if you want fast, fluid, but not as straight forward as it seems, sort of 4X game that has lasting rewards which can roll over into other games via the single player Empire Mode \u2013 then yeah, pick this game up.\n\nBut only buy this game at a DEEP DEEP discount. I paid less than $20 for the full package, all DLC, Premium edition, and I feel that was the perfect price. If I paid any more than that, I\u2019d be pretty upset and feel a bit cheated.", "timestamp_created": 1610826306, "timestamp_updated": 1610827906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "84806587": {"recommendationid": "84806587", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969538443", "num_games_owned": 679, "num_reviews": 372, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 599, "last_played": 1605320449}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2800", "timestamp_created": 1610825025, "timestamp_updated": 1610825025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "84791628": {"recommendationid": "84791628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346367781", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 1092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1092, "last_played": 1610807314}, "language": "english", "review": "Game plays nicely.

As far as campaigns go, it was not captivating to me. The story begins with space cops waking up after 200 years to realize that the space cops broke up long ago. And I am perfectly fine with the beginning being the end result. I think my alignments would be to a more evil faction in the long run, because trying to play good or neutral is not my forte when all other commanders were hostile. They spent half the game breaking treaties regardless of being WAY weaker than I was. I just waited until the war was considered justified then wiped the map clean. When an opposing commander pisses me off, I want to end them right away. So waiting to attack was super lame, as was dancing around commanders that had every intention of killing me no matter what I did. Couldn't bribe them. Couldn't do the missions for one without hurting the other. Etc.\n\nI missed the depth of factions from AoW3. The factions in this case were so limited. Not seeing many third party factions that were willing to negotiate. The only 3rd party factions I ran into were all under the same flag and I wasn't able to negotiate with any of them, ruining the variety I enjoyed in the other games. I absolutely loved the depth of characters you could meet and how some of them were hostile while others just wanted to chill in their little corner of the world. In Planetfall those fun little buddies are all replaced with hostile marauders who will not negotiate at all.\n\nTL;DR: It's definitely a new spin on a fun series. Expect changes in tactics and enemy choices and story arcs and controls. It keeps the basics all in line with a few fun changes to the map work. Battles are similar too. As well as controls being easy to pick up after playing 3. Only problem is that picking it up after playing 3 makes me want to go back to 3 and play it more. I can't thumbs down a good game, and this is a good game. It's just not AS good as I had expected form the series. I usually love space themes being added to games, but in this case it just didn't do it for me.\n\nI got this game in a bundle sale, and if you love the turn based strategy genre you ought to get this game on sale too.

Tech tree isn't too big but I liked the idea that you can study both military and society techs at the same time. Singleplayer campaigns are mediocre; there were far too many factions and I quickly lost track who is who. Other disadvantages? Tutorial wasn't the best; for example: it didn't explain that I can use diplomacy to gain control of sectors. I felt like AI was too passive on some maps.

Absolute [dolphin noises] amazing graphical quality and art style, Whoever designed these maps, units, buildings, ships, etc. we're now married and I won't hear anything else. I was/am honestly in love with this game because it gives SO MUCH VARIETY of gameplay. I've played more 4X games the past six months than I care to admit, and this one did good for about four hours. After that you realize that it's another paradox system that fails to apply it's own logic. These games are meant to be hard, they're meant to make you plan and stress. Here, if you want to avoid war, spend influence every three turns to avoid OP NPCs. If you want to trade for resources, NPCs somehow think giving you 10 energy for an entire territory is commensurate. Enemy factions refuse vassalization despite having NO CITIES and only two territories. Enemy turns pause for some odd reason when you zoom out of the map. and I could go on for days about the idiosyncrasies of Paradox games. Ultimately I'm let down again by paradox because they've got such a great formula but the programming and direction smear acrid feces all over their amazing projects. I take that back it was too harsh, I'm not let down, I'm saddened that the minds behind such a great concept keep getting sabotaged by people lying on their resume. It's not too late, maybe an update will come across to address issues that are easily pointed out in the Alpha stages. \n\nI'm not recommending for a few reason:\n-typical paradox 4X mid/late game nonsense: Just focus on building a ridiculously strong army. The game says you can win in other ways, but it will look for reasons to drag you into combat regardless if you're in non-aggression and defense pacts with everyone on the map. Again, minding your own business can be an act of war. \n\n-conquered that planet? Feel good? Well that space faring civilization that you spend hours building into an unstoppable mutant factory, yeah the ones going on a campaign of galactic conquest? yeah they forgot all of that knowledge and research on the last planet, do it all over again. Those weapons are gone too. With the premise being galactic conquest, I highly doubt any space faring civilization save the Yautja would just start from scratch again. I'm minimizing, there's global class and technology progress but the rewards are paltry the first few levels\n\n- if you refuse or otherwise fail missions from NPCs, it's an act of war and that first bullet becomes really relevant. Not sure why a living plant is beefing with robots but it's obviously a grievous insult if someone else comes along and kills them. \n\n-They half [dolphin noises]  the soundtrack compared to their other titles.

It uses pre-selected borders like Civ 6 or Endless Legend now, which does seem like it makes for more interesting gameplay.

Instead they have this 'sectors' system where you can annex adjacent territory to support a central colonies. I've never seen something quite like it, it's very fun though. I like the victory conditions more, too. They're a little bit more 'quest-like' rather than just King of the Hill or elimination.  \n\nOverall it's a great 4X game, especially if you're just looking to get into the genre and want something with a little more fantasy than Civ. It's a little more complicated than AoW III and Civ, but not much. Still much easier to pick up than Endless, or Stellaris, imo, and for sure a lot shorter than either of those two.

From the combat, units, world, lore, etc.  It was just so much better.  The combat was difficult, empire management fun, and had a futuristic feel to it which is great since there are so few of these kind of games.  I felt I had different choices on how I wanted to manage my empire, which is always a bonus.\n\n[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]\n\nI felt like content was skimped on.  I know DLCs have come out to pad out the gameplay, but I haven't gone back to see if it really improves the game.  I also know there is a bunch of DLC, which detracts from games like this since you need to buy all of the content to really enjoy the game.\n\n[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]\n\nAnother game caught my eye and I felt like there wasn't enough content to keep me going.\n\n[b] Disclaimer [/b]\n\nI have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.

If you like the 4X style it's likely you will be happy. This game is an unpolished jewel and can easily give many hours of fun. With some further development for the next iteration, perhaps focusing on immersion, it could become great.\n\n[b]The Gameplay:[/b]\n- The AI is surprisingly good. \n- Diplomacy is good and engaging, there are enough options and the AI is surprisingly adequate.\n- A smooth experience, short loading times, fairly few bugs.\n- Plenty of possibilities for discovering synergies between units and upgrades. Some combinations are slightly overpowered.\n- Lots of important and engaging strategic decisions to make.\n- Base building is underwhelming, probably to make it easier on the AI.\n- Development and tech offers plenty of options and decision making.\n- Options for different play styles, diplomacy, war etc.\n- The game lacks story/lore to make you invested and feel what this universe is like, why you are fighting and such. I would have liked bigger differences between races than there are. For example the Syndicate are traders but seemingly play the same way as other races.\n- The campaigns story is somewhat cringeworthy due to the dialogue. I couldn't make it past a few turns.\n- Lots of replayability, due to a variety of units and tech.\n- For some strange reason, the database with information about the game is not structured alphabetically, making reading about the game annoying.\n\n[b]The Visuals:[/b]\n- Rough and underwhelming animations. Overall ok but often breaks immersion.\n- Units that looks strong are weak and vice versa. Can be a bit unsatisfying.\n- Some menus are strangely sloppy. For example, when recruiting units in a city, there's a clogged up menu with all units and all unit variations in the same place. It would be much better if unit variations are subcategories of units.\n- The combat is tile based, all units use 1 tile which becomes weird when some units clearly are meant to be big but instead are small.\n\n[b]The Sound:[/b]\n- Sound FX is poor and unsatisfying. The sound is often out of sync with animations. A big tank firing really does sound like \"pew-pew\".\n- The music does what it should, nothing special but it works.\n- There is an announcer during the combat that is quite weird and breaks the immersion, saying things such as \"unit lost\".", "timestamp_created": 1609013943, "timestamp_updated": 1609098465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "83177558": {"recommendationid": "83177558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316580012", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3650, "last_played": 1610164242}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent and so engaging game!

No jokes, I spent 3 days thinking over it.\n\nLet's start nice and easy. The game itself is beautiful, many details and colors included. Audio of the game is awesome, especially when you're in the battle mode and hear your soldiers gunning down the enemy. Explosions are juicy and you can see their effects as they will leave scars on the battlefield and most of covers in the game are destructible so you can use one unit to destroy cover and let others gun the enemy.\n\nI quite like the dark story from the fact that the space empire was destroyed, shattered and spread all over diffrent worlds and factions. There are many factions to play as and despite being the same faction as another player you might play diffrent technology tree. It's mostly special units, operations and buffs for your empire.\n\nYou also have your own 'Empire Creation' in game. Make an emblem and color it... Uhhh, yeah. You can't give it any real story but you might conquer planets. You start with nothing but your empire can capture planets where you drop into the game. You also get many additional bonuses and resources for doing optional quests that appear diffrent to each planet and second optional quests that appear as you play the map, usually it's the type of 'destroy that', 'research this special technology we'll give you' or 'kill this army'.\n\nNow, let's move onto what's bad... And that's mechanics, units and overall combat gameplay.\n\nUnits are... Well, they're the same. Every unit in every faction has it's exact counterpart in the other. There's no diffrent units for each faction, they're all the same just reskinned ( I think that maybe FINAL unit is a bit diffrent ). This makes faction irrelevent to each other as they each have the same units that do the same. The only difference is the fact that one prefers to shoot with bullets, other with acid and yet the other like flames.\n\nNow, onto diplomacy... It's broken. You can win the game by having 1 city and not doing anything 95% of the game. One of \npossible conditions for winning is to unite the planet. When you first start and meet a faction - like in any other game of this type - a window pop ups and you can talk with them. You get a headstart by just saying 'hi'. You can spend a literal change of your influence to go to faction and say 'hey, buddy, good work out there' and they like you even more. You can sign a non-agression pact and get even more relations along with a bunch of other little nonsense that will bost it further... Ah, yes, you have to wait 2 turns with each relation change so you can't go to defense alliance right after signing non-agression pact, so you'll getting 'hold back'.\n\nNow, AI during war is... weird. When the enemy AI plays and you declare war on them - or they on you - you might go to your allies and ask for help in fighting them. My allies ALWAYS declined despite being on the highest possible relationship level 'Alliance' and them HATING the other faction. If they decline it breaks all your treaties. AI's allies will always join them... You know where this is going, right?\n\nGoing for a full agressive playstyle - no alliances, war on faction when you're ready to take them over - is dumb, boring, annoying and overall not fun. I wanted to make Psynumbra Empire that takes out other people and brainwash them to fight for their leader. AI declared war on me and moved from their territory - good few turns away - to my freshly settled city in matter of 2 turns... With normal units. Not flying scouts... Normal units, over forests and a river on the way. It's really breaking the possibility to RP anything other than diplomats.\n\nEnemy army building will leave you feeling weak and weird. While you have 5 cities and fight enemy with 3 his forces will be easily doubling yours. You look at your income to see you're almost in the red and you need to wait 2-3 turns just to recruit the most basic units - without upgrades that make unit cost more and you need special resource for it - while enemy start spamming upgraded units despite having 2x weaker economy than you and no access to special resource outside of basic +5 from the game.\n\nFighting is turn based and defender always starts first... Multiple armies can take part in fighting leading to giant fights and that makes it very long and time-consuming just for a single turn to end. Some units also summon units... Yeah, at some point you end turn and just go make youself something to eat 'cause you're gonna be here a while.\n\nThe game could be far better but combat system was butchered.", "timestamp_created": 1608557563, "timestamp_updated": 1608557563, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506975889205932617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "82776077": {"recommendationid": "82776077", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965493252", "num_games_owned": 587, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1411, "last_played": 1608422250}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not a *terrible* game, but it is charmless and lacking in a hard to describe \"fun\" factor.

It also feels odd to have totally unmitigated Horizontal expansion- the game forces you to play wide, not tall.  A slight lack of polish.  Basically, I still liked the game, but I had much more enjoyment playing Age of Wonders III.\n\nNow however, after multiple DLC's and patches, I find the game state to be polished and very well done.  Combat / Questing / Unit Modding are just as good as originally, with even more variety due to new factions and additions.  My major complaints with the district system were shored up by the allowance of urban districts that both let you strategically expand further than 2 zones from your city, and benefit from more vertical-built cityscapes.  Future techs don't just end now, you can continue researching for a variety of worthwhile bonuses - meaning your research is no longer useless later in the game, but continually beneficial.  While you do still need to play wide, having additional vertical benefits present doesn't make this feel quite as forced as previously.\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend the game in it's current state.

Think Civilization combined with the turn-based combat from X-Com.  This game is a must-buy for any fan of the previous Age of Wonders games.  It's also a good choice for anyone looking for a sci-fi themed strategy game that focuses heavily on the combat aspect of 4x games.\n\n[u] Campaign [/u]\nDecent.  Not as good a story as the campaign in Age of Wonders 3, but it still serves as a good introduction to the different races and secret technologies.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nLooks very nice on high graphics settings.  Haven't had any compatability issues, and it is not very taxing compared to a lot of other modern games.  Good combat animations.\n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nBackground music is decent; it does a good job at setting the mood, but I can't say any of the tracks stuck in my head afterwards.  Combat sound design is excellent and really adds weight to the animations: everything from gunfire to explosions to claw swipes.  The voice acting is decent as well, though certain lines are perhaps overused for in-game events.\n\n[u] AI [/u]\nThe AI is pretty standard for 4x games.  Not amazing, but not horrible.  Still exploitable even on the hardest difficulty, like almost all AIs.\n\n[u] Empire Building [/u]\nEmpire building is fairly basic in this game, like most Age of Wonders games.  It serves its purpose, and there are usually enough interesting choices to be made, but it's not the depth found in something like Civilization 4.  Diplomacy is fairly standard for modern 4x games as well.\n\n[u] Multiplayer [/u]\nThere is a small but dedicated multiplayer community for this game.  It's not why I, personally, play the game, so I can't say much more than that.\n\n[u] Developer Support [/u]\nTriumph Studios is extremely good at making relevant and good updates to this game.

This sounds like a match made in heaven, except that makes this title more like a jack of all trades, master of none. Note: This is my first AOW game.\n\nThe tactical battles have no significant impact beyond losing a few units on the map if you screw up (and you can retry as much as you want anyway). Often 'auto combat' has good enough results, meaning the stakes for going into manual combat are just not very enticing. The XCOM-factor is severely reduced in that matter.\n\nThe strategic side feels better. The world map has a fine amount of terrain/landmark/bonus resources for base planning, especially with Residential Sectors. You can't choose where to place your cities except the sector center, but that's okay I guess. There are plenty of covert and non-covert operations to take, as well as varied win conditions. But, domination is probably the VC you'll be getting the most often.\n\nResearch is the biggest letdown in my opinion. Society Research is too 'robotic'. Researching 'Production Development II' over 'Energy Development II' feels like very yucky filler content and leaves very little to flavor or imagination. However, if you'd remove/reorganize them so you wouldn't have to research over 10 different 'Development' researches, there's barely any tech tree left.\nOn the other extreme, Military Research has a separate multi-row tech tree for every single race, supported by two weapons trees and one secret tech tree. As you can found colonies of other races in the game, these tech trees are then added to your possible research, and of course this means your research tree gets so big you need a drop-down button to switch between the different parts.\n\nThe base content can feel underwhelming, despite the potential loads of customization that you can do (select a race, a secret technology, and traits).

I guess\nThe economics is pretty simple actually, so I won't say it's anything special \nThe diplomacy isn't good, mostly because the AI can be cheesed and 3/4 of the mechanics aren't relevant when you're playing with an actual human (You probably won't, but even if you do, you won't enjoy it)\nThere's also a god-awful story mode, but we don't talk about that, alright?\n\nThat's the simple way of describing what you get, but I'm not writing my longest review about a game putting it simply, let's go into the advanced parts\n\nThese are the races -\n\nStupid woman animal taming bio engineering bullshit\n\nTheir weapons make no sense and it's not as cool as you think\nBugs who were oppressed\n-\nThey're ok\n Generic space-faring humans\n-\nTruly are generic, boring to play and bland\n OP DLC race of mary-sue allgood people \n-\nP2W garbage with mech suits, ... cool..?\n Ugly zombie/robot hybrids (Would've been better being all-robot)\n\nYeah not much to say about these assholes\nSpace-mining midgets \n-\nThey're like the human race, but smaller and with a different colour scheme\n\nThere might be another one, but they aren't memorable at all\n\nSo those races have different tech trees with \"damage channels\", like biochemical poison and psionic magic stuff. Each race has 2 of them, so for example the bugs have biochemical and psionic. Good stuff.\n\nThis pretty much dictates how you play and what damage you have, so choose your race wisely!\n\nThe 4x-style map is pretty standard but has visual bugs, like invisible parts of colony buildings and blurred-out POIs, as well as low-res textures for no reason (playing on ultra and these bugs still remain), if you can ignore that then great, but you won't ignore the next part\n\nTactical combat (Xcom style turn based stuff) Honestly this is ridiculous, the maps are so low quality. Look into the background of any forest map and you'll see floating rocks, floating PNGs of trees and the abyss. Really lazy for a game that costs \u00a342 without DLCs... One could argue it's to save FPS, but it's a bad job of it. All maps feel the same, especially colony maps. They don't create an atmosphere and maybe that was intentional, - maybe you were meant to only look at the units, not admire the craftsmanship of the environments around you...\n\nNot to mention, there's cringy voice lines for when you either lose a unit or kill an enemy. Especially the humans, their voice actor sounds way too excited \n\nMusic is nothing special, it kinda sucks tbh... Doesn't make you feel like you're waging a planet-scale war, it makes you feel like you're fighting a skirmish against random enemies (which, admittedly, you are most of the time, but that doesn't excuse the music lacking elsewhere) \n\nThe AI stays the same regardless of difficulty, let me explain...\n\nEasy AI starts with less stuff, but they act the same\nNormal AI starts with the same stuff as you, but they act the same\nHard AI starts with more stuff than you, but they act the same\nAnd so on....\nNot to mention, if you tick the box \"teams\", then the AI will be at war with you immediately. It'd make for good fun with a friend, if it wasn't for the fact that the AI has secret omnipresence and knows exactly where you are instantly... So much for staying concealed, huh? \n\nI'm glad I got this game on sale, because it lacks in many areas and honestly is only worth 1/2 of its price. Maybe 3/4 if I'm being generous.\n\nTo close off, let's talk about the community - Honestly, I loathe it. They analyse every part of the game to gain such a minimal advantage that it only matters in the long run after a long, long time. It seems so sweaty and there's no laid-back players anymore, people like me, who just play for fun. Instead, they treat it as if it's some tournament. That's why I only play with my friends, and you should do the same. I'll be honest, just don't touch whatever community this game has left, because this game's popularity dropped like a fly\n\nTL : DR Don't buy this AOW:Planetfailure", "timestamp_created": 1606566205, "timestamp_updated": 1618661114, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "80848118": {"recommendationid": "80848118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014626519", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 38557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8608, "last_played": 1613770109}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best 4x games I've played.

This was a problem at least with AoW III, and it is very much a problem with AoW PF. I won't pretend that I'm the greatest at the game theoretically, but I'm good enough both with the genre and the game in question that there's no reason low level AI's should be easily and routinely wiping the floor with me regardless of my meta, micro, or macro strategies, and yet they do and always have because they aren't given the same restrictions as players are, and it is frequently made very very obvious that this is the case.

Take a look at my play times for Civ6, Gladius, Endless Legend and X-Com and you'll see i'm no casual.\n\nI had such high hopes for Planetfall. At first glance it seemed to check all the boxes. But as i kept playing i started to see the holes that the developers left and seem to refuse to fix. If you're not too fussy with the little things, then you'll probably enjoy the game. But as someone who worked as a game developer, I can't abide.\n\n[u]The good[/u]\n1. Probably the thing this game does better than any other strategy is the relationship between the tactical and world maps. You can group units into squads and teams into larger armies that fight together depending on how they're placed on the world map. The terrain is wildly different depending whether you're fighting in a city, the countryside, or special world tiles. And when you get a full 7 squad battle, it's really satisfying to see it played out in the tactical map.\n2. Unit customization is amazing. With all the different upgrades for the units you can really fine tune how your army fights. Up against a lot of machines? Load up on electrical weapons. The enemy is hold up behind a defensive wall with turrets? Put some jetpacks and grenades on your dudes and Starship Trooper that jazz.\n3. The landmasses and terrain are more organic and natural. The game is hex based but the world is split up into regions that vary in size and utility. It makes defending your territory feel more strategic.\n4. The Galactic Empire is a great feature that is unique to Planetfall as far as i know. Each planet you play has unique features that allow you to unlock relics and units with other factions for future games. It makes each game feel important feels like you're working toward something.\n\n[u]The bad[/u]\n1. The races are symmetrical. Every race has the same version of each unit; scout, light infantry, skirmisher, support, flying, heavy, and ultimate form. They all do almost the same thing and cost the same across all races. Feels extremely lazy and adds a repetitive nature. Gladius does an excellent job of having unique races while still being balanced if you want to see an example.\n2. Too. Many. Different. Status effects. Seriously, this is something they need to fix. If you're going to have so many status effects, then there needs to be a better way of finding out which ones are on your units. Currently, you have to exit the tactical screen and go to the unit's personal info screen. The status effects are thrown into a bucket of information which can sometimes be difficult to parse. On top of that, there are redundant status effects. For fire alone there is burning, immolated, and charred which honestly could just be the same status effect with increasing levels of damage and effects.\n3. The DLC is bland and repetitive. When every race is symmetrical, then every new race you add is too similar to what's already there. Instead of adding a bunch of new interchangeable races, they should have worked on filling out the current ones so they feel more unique. \n4. It's the bad kind of turn based. Can you imagine playing a game of chess where each player gets to move all their pieces each turn? Final Fantasy Tactics showed us over 20 years ago how to do turn based right, and this game more than any could benefit from speed based individual unit turns. Remember those 7 squad battles? well that's 42 total units on the screen, and some of those units can summon other units. It's not strategy when 20 enemy units can all go one after another, and all target the same unit.\n\n[u]The ugly[/u]\n1. Every game has bugs, but this one has some doozies. The worst one that i've encountered so far is the game being unable to get through the computer's turn. Sometimes the computer takes a while because it has a bunch of battles to get through, and then sometimes it just hangs there indefinitely. There's no way of knowing the game has crashed until you wait a stupid amount of time. The only fix is to reload the previous turn. And if you've just fought a 7 squad battle which can take forever, that's a lot of your life to just incinerate. There are other game breaking bugs, but honestly that one is enough for me to never touch this game again. \n2. The UX was designed by Satan's nutsack. It's inconsistent, not intuitive, not clear. Honestly for me this might be the worst thing about the game.

The graze mechanic is \"supposedly\" included to make missing less frustrating, but all it does is turn your 3 90% shots into duds. Information about game mechanics is absolute trash, both the wiki and the in-game help seem vastly incomplete with some pages or descriptions missing completely. The competence mechanic is totally skewed against the player, it's not uncommon to be ranked first in diplomacy and development and still be last in total because the AI spams units.\n\nSpeaking of which, for a \"tactical game\", there sure is a lot of emphasis on unit spam. Most units take less than a couple of turns to build, making spam (the enemy of tactical gameplay) too common, especially for the AI. It's pretty normal to see them running around with a whole pile of unit stacks and, because the AI cheats to keep up with the player, makes this extremely tedious to deal with. To put this in perspective, I've never lost a war, despite being totally outnumbered. This isn't fun, this isn't challenging. It's friggen tedious and mentally taxing.\n\nI really liked it when I first started playing, but the more I've played, the more glaring the flaws are. There's simply too much bull and not enough information at your hands with a considerable lack of tools to deal with all the game's faults. It has a lot of promise, but is fundamentally flawed. A few tweaks to basic game mechanics would go a long way towards improving the game:\n\n1. Unit upkeep/ cost: Increase this and make it even harsher for stacks that lack a leader/hero. This makes it so making a huge army actually requires infrastructure. Units should also take longer to build, losing units IN A STRATEGY GAME should be more punishing rather than a minor inconvenience.\n\n2. Better/cleaner information: Right now, the information available to the player is extremely bare bones. To put this into perspective, the wiki's page that lists AI diplo weights (traits) doesn't even describe them, it's literally just a list, no subsections dedicated to them. There's absolutely no information on AI dislikes at all and you have to actually dig for this information or post in the forums. That's just bad form and it feels lazy.\n\n3. Retweak the RNG: As previously stated, there's too much that's dependant on randomness. The Oathbound does a good job of including abilities that allow you to mitigate the amount of RNG, but EVERY faction needs this. A good player formulates strategies that rely as little as possible on randomness, but this game has too much of it and not enough ways to deal with it.\n\nTLDR: Good potential, bad execution.

Each race has a secret tech that jives 100% with them, however all secret tech does is provided extra units and skills...and each secret tech has a win condition item.  I play assembly, with secret tech that adds units that use the damage my race uses, provided mech/cyborg anti unit skills, and creates a win condition ballisk network, i build 3 expensive towers one per city, then research down the singularity event, prime the skill, once launched i win in 10 turns unless stopped.  Every secret tech has one like it.  This gives you an out vs wiping the floor for 200 turns exterminating everyone.  Its brilliant once you do it a few times.\n\nLast tech in both social and millitary is called future tech.  Its a brilliant end game research that is infinately repeatable, once completed grants an empire bonus.  Think +5 energy per citizen, or +2 arc damage, ect.  Very useful and makes endgame research useful which is new for 4x\n\nGear/Units:  Basic.  Every game ive played each hero ends the game with the same weapons they sarted with, i get 3 (4 for some heros) slots for gear, small effects are added, nothing fancy or special or fun.  Seriously lacking department for the game.  For a game that cuts out most complexities they leave this part open to confusing menus on items, its hard to tell with most items any change in play.\n\nCombat: XCOM with cover function.  Its a great addition i love it, but i still auto battle 95% of my battles and that sucks.  Their efforts to make combat engaging in a 4x failed as i still skip most battles.  the new mechanics are fun but serve to draw out even longer the typically long drawn out boring manual battles of all 4x.  \n\nDLC/Money grubbing: Standard issue, though DLC seems to bring a lot of content along with the questionable new faction.  Like with most 4x, never not buy it on sale.\n\nStar King DLC brings something new to the table. Galaxy Mode,  Account stats.  Create your hero, then \"conquer worlds\" it tracks the conquered planets, each planet has unlocks and items and units and account currency.  End of match you get a massive XP/Unlock tracking screen to see the amount of XP/Levels per in game faction (NPC and Human factions).  Each start of game you can spend currency earned doing game quests and achievements to add starting units, skills beyond what you would get in game under your current faction/secret tech selection ect.\n\nGalaxy mode gives you this sort of rogue light account to the 4x, which stives you to play another game.  Its fantastic.  Without it id probably have stopped playing after one mega long match.  This needs to stay for every future 4x.\n\nIn game i get a random quest pop up for some other faction, giving me account currency and XP for that faction the unlock more of their gear ect....its a faction that has something i want, now i care about said quest.  Its fun playing and seeing all the various factions i aided or destroyed be converted into XP into them.\n\nOverall: game is hard to recommend for die hard 4x players unless you want exposure to the galaxy more, cant stand how overly complicated 4x games have become, or want to enjoy a more complete manual combat.  If galaxy mode doesnt sink its teeth into you there wont be much here.  This game feels more like a turn based RTS than a true 4x.\n\nGet it on sale, and lets hope the next 4x they make adds back the complexity and depth and retains galaxy mode and the end game \"future tech\" research item and the secret techs win conditions.  Three great mechanics that will add to the 4x genre.\n\nWhile this game brings 3 brilliant new mechanics to 4x, it just wont sink its teeth into you like a good Faraxis or Amplitude game, even AOW3 is more complex.  While the combat mechanic additions are nice, it serves to do the opposite of making 4x combat battles something i crave.  Youll skip most so, the cover mechanics, just wont be appreciated as the main point of playing like they wanted.  Mostly youll be using future tech quick win conditions to grind XP for TONS of factions for fun stuff and collect planets which are just game wins.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1605538805, "timestamp_updated": 1605538805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535452306270599365", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "79355259": {"recommendationid": "79355259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158762766", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1102, "last_played": 1605601461}, "language": "english", "review": "Somewhat like a combination of early Civilization-type games (where units can stack) and X-Com (turn-based combat).

It is a clear upgrade when it comes to performance and graphics, but it seems like it has lost a lot of the lustre from the former games. The races seems kind of unimaginative and dull with some pretty poor \u201cclass\u201d combinations, the customisation for the leaders are shallow at best, and there are only so many different ways that you can make a gun firing interesting. The combat maps are beautiful, but there are so many small details that makes it difficult to decern your own units from the terrain. When it comes to the setting, fantasy is always easier to draw inspiration from then sci-fi, so the units design would always have ended up with the risk of been a hit or miss dependant on the players preference, so it\u2019s sad that they didn\u2019t work out for me. Other than that, the tech trees are also kind of a let-down, they\u2019ve taken the Civ6 route of having the technology have small quotes attached to it. But unlike with Civ6 which has quotes from different historic people, these are just made-up quotes from the Planetfall universe, and even though that could work, in execution it feels very uninteresting and ineffectual. The actual technology you research isn\u2019t that intriguing either, so it\u2019s always tiresome to go in a pick you next tech. And the most important part for me, is that it doesn\u2019t feel like an epic journey, the things you do from one turn to another feels very impact less, and I don\u2019t really feel like a lost remnant of a fallen empire. I feel more than anything just like a someone whose job it is to clean up the mess that has been left behind by some unknown partygoers.

It's all defined if you look it up but you really are dropped in at the deep end.\n\nSignificant changes from Age of Wonders:\nTactical combat is better and slightly more complex than AoW.\nEnd game isn't just spamming higher tier units, because of the mod system you can customize units to provide slightly different roles, it also means your end game armies will optimally be using a great variety of units as you can create really nice synergy, even with modded tier 1 units.\nThere is a game mode that links together games, where you are conquering planets.  This is way better than it sounds, as you will feel a connection to things you have done before, you will level up and be doing missions in games to improve your galactic progress, Commanders you have in your empire will turn up as heroes in your games.  I literally jumped straight in to another game after my last because of the feeling of progression and connection that carries over.  1 more turn is endless.\nIn Age of Wonders the class of your leader was the most significant with the race having a subtle effect, it is somewhat in reverse in Planetfall.  Race is the most important choice, with secret tech having a more subtle but not insignificant effect.\nSo far I've found less broken overpowered things than in Age of Wonders. Age of Wonders you could really do some silly things with indestructible heroes and even units, I haven't found ways to do things as silly as that, which is a great thing for longevity.\n\nFor anyone else who hasn't played AoW, Planetfall plays similarly to 4X games but with good tactical combat.

Do not come here expecting AOW3. There are some faction campaigns which lay down a little bit of light story, but it is not an in-depth rpg. There are few methods to achieve victory in the game beyond simply finding and conquering your enemies. Every unit and hero in the game is customizable which is pretty cool. The customization comes mainly from researching the faction respective military tech trees, there is also some cross faction tech that is potentially un-lockable for added modding of your units. The diplomacy features in the game are not always straightforward, since the AI respond to many different in-game variables, so an allied AI on one turn could suddenly turn on you a few turns later given the right circumstances. The tactical combat in the game is very cool.  Ranged units have a significant advantage over melee units (unless you mod your melee units really well), so keep this in mind when assembling your armies. The empire building aspects of the game are mainly designed to help produce and support units to wage/defend against other armies.

A thin \"strategic (world-level) shell around a rather deeply developed tactical core. With this being said: \n\nThe 4X component of this game is weak (especially when compared to games like CIV5 or Crusader Kings or Stellaris). The buildings you are able to construct within your cities are all essentially a bland choice of military vs civil. The technology tree is similarly dull. However, I did enjoy the vast number of strategic operations and think that in a multiplayer setting they could prove to be hilarious. Imagine stealing all of your buddies ongoing research for yourself.... yeah >> they gonna be pissed XD \n\nWhen this game is viewed from the tactical perspective however, things get a lot more interesting. I like how you are able to re-kit your armies depending on who you are fighting. I like the many tactical operations available and also the various unit abilities (with their different ranges and damage types and DoT/AoE options) and the choices they present. \n\nI wasn't all too fond of the art direction of the game... For example, many of the Assembly units seemed roughshod, the Dwar - a stereotypical Dwarf-like race was uninspiring as well... \n\nThe game lagged on the largest world with 1 human and 12 AI.... Very annoying amounts of lag indeed.\nOverall, this game gives the impression of an unpolished semi-precious gem. There will be people that can look past all the rough edges (and there are many), but unfortunately, I am not one of them.\n\nFor a better Tactical strategy game I recommend: Shadow Tactics, or the upcoming Partisans 1941...\n\nENVOY RATED: 5/10", "timestamp_created": 1603592669, "timestamp_updated": 1603592669, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496537089347839355", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "78082156": {"recommendationid": "78082156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028748134", "num_games_owned": 441, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 529, "last_played": 1603564804}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game!", "timestamp_created": 1603557767, "timestamp_updated": 1603557767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "78039245": {"recommendationid": "78039245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044201605", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1689, "last_played": 1582874777}, "language": "english", "review": "Unfortunately, the game crashes at random times far into the game and saving of course doesn't work properly.

Triumph Studios brings a brand-new styled Strategy game, featuring all exciting tactical battles and in-depth building mechanics to let you experience the gorgeous gameplay, unlike its predecessors. Many legendary heroes emerge from the dark age of the fallen empire to build a new realm for you. Triumph Studios (the creator of the most anticipated game series, Age of Wonders) is featuring the tactical battle and building to a massive space environment inspired by a sci-fi setting. Different types of factions are available; each one introduces a varied set of abilities, units, and more.\n\n[h1]Gameplay \u2013 Build Your Epic Empire[/h1]\nSimilar to previous titles, your ultimate goal is the creation of your empire by selecting one of the six different factions, ranging from the Cyborg-zombies to the dinosaur-riding Amazons. Explore the environment from a top-down view and attempt to progress through a set of missions using your military strength, diplomacy, and wits. As the game starts, find yourself in the planetary ruins, navigating the environment, while struggling to encounter and rescue other people like you. Reveal the history of the shattered civilization and start batting against enemies using your epic powers to be the winner.\n\n[b]Introduction of Turn-based Combat in Sci-fi Setting[/b]\nLike other Strategy games, you need to master all of your plans while trying to raid on enemies for ingame resources and other inventory items. Therefore, before attacking, ensure your strategy is perfect and will work in intense turn-based fights that introduces a massive cast of factions, destructible environments, and customization units. Enemies will appear in hordes, and you should always be ready to command your units to raid your opponents and take over them to expand your territory.\n\n[b]A Blend of 4X, Sci-fi, and Turn-based Strategy[/b]\nIt provides you a massive map for navigation and pits you and other factions against each other for glory and fame. Undoubtedly, you should need a proper strategic plan to guarantee success in Turn-based Strategy games, because luck doesn\u2019t work here. The 4x genre contains four popular sub-genres, which include: \n\u2022\tExplore\n\u2022\tExpand\n\u2022\tExploit \n\u2022\tExterminate\n\nIn short, 4X is a sub-genre of a strategic-based board game, which is found in RTS and Turn-based Combat titles. The primary gameplay involves the creation of empire and granting you the power to control both non-military and other units for supremacy. \n\n[h1]Reveal Dark Secrets[/h1]\nMany secrets of the universe remained to be discovered in the previous titles; therefore, you are here to reveal them, while exploring the history of the fallen empire. During the game, you should discover the Star Union\u2019s Fate by navigating lush environments containing landscapes, wild wastelands, and megacities. Throughout the game, the major struggle is finding rival factions and revealing hidden technologies in abandoned places.\n\n[h1]The Verdict[/h1]\nWith high-quality graphics and multiple game modes, you can engage yourself for endless hours of fun. Developers did a great job by offering in-depth graphics and different playable factions. We would love to rate it 9.5 over 10 because of its smooth and fabulous gameplay. \n\nRating: 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1603296083, "timestamp_updated": 1603296105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501483678817749023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "77919325": {"recommendationid": "77919325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301682836", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1148, "last_played": 1603666852}, "language": "english", "review": "I personally enjoyed AoW:P.

Play this instead. \n\nI picked this up through Humble Choice, and wasn't expecting to think much of it -- I'm much more to the Civ and Stellaris side of 4X gaming -- but, much to my surprise, I found a game which took all the potential of Endless Space II & Endless Legend and gave me something I could actually work with. See, while I enjoy cool battles and leveling up my units, I don't want that to be the only thing I'm doing -- and I *certainly* don't want that to be the *main* thing I'm doing. \n\nPlanetfall lets me focus on planning and growing my civilization in peaceful/defensive ways, while exploring the various cool sites scattered around the map. It's much easier to nerf my opponents/make them peaceful than it has been in other games in this sort, and that suits my low-key playstyle just fine. When I want challenges, I go after the increasingly difficult npcs/'barbarian'-type units out there -- which can also be set not to attack, if that's your thing. \n\nReviewers who have said that you can't play a peaceful game with Planetfall are only partially correct. This is by no means as mellow a game as you can get with the proper settings on, say, Civ V or VI. However, if you're the kind of person who occasionally needs to stomp assorted beings while slowly ascending to galactic superiority? \n\nYou can do a lot worse than this. \n\n*thinks* I described it to one of my partners as Civ Meets Diablo, but I think it's actually a lot more like one of my beloved sim-farming games on a decidedly epic scale. Like, you're rebuilding Portia... world.\n\nAdd in the great music, the fun voice acting, and, again, the fact that the game is freakin' gorgeous -- call it 7.5/10. I'd give it an even higher grade, but a lot of the fun/customizability is coming from fan-mods and paid dlcs.

I've had a lot of time to try several of these sorts of games that are considered the top games in the category lately. Civ, Total War games, Stellaris, Endless Legend, the list goes on, but I always come back to this one.\n\nNOTE: Many of the reviews for this game were from when the game was released, since then they did a massive update that re-balanced the game and overhauled several mechanics. A lot of the comments in negative reviews were from a year+ ago using the old mechanics. This game is being actively improved / patched as of Oct 2020 from what I've seen and they're still releasing an expansion.\n\nI'll get the cons out of the way first:\n\nCONS: \n- The campaign storyline is pretty poorly written compared to the rest of the game and its lore excerpts. They definitely need an editor. I still really enjoyed the campaign though, and definitely think it's worth it to learn the game. I don't think Civ even had a campaign..\n\n- Some minor bugs encountered during the campaign, but the game is constantly saving every turn so it wasn't a gigantic deal to reload\n\n- On extra large maps with tons of opponents the game gets pretty heavy on the CPU around turn 70+. Turns take around 15-30s seconds for me at that point on a fairly strong i7 from 3 years ago. I didn't encounter this on non-huge maps or when using Simultaneous Turns mode to speed things up.\n\n- The game can be a bit overwhelming if you're totally unfamiliar with Age of Wonders, so you'll probably be playing at least 2 maps before you get the hang of things. I shouldn't need to warn people but 4X games are time consuming, heh.\n\n- The AI could still use improvement. They make some questionable military decisions at times and you can fleece them in diplomacy if you're clever enough. I didn't have problems adding more enemies/setting various options to up the difficulty though.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Campaign is like 200 hours+ of gameplay in the base game alone. It's... quite a bit longer than that if you are taking your time. You will be getting your money's worth if you stick to this game.\n\n- Good UI scaling if you play on a TV or super high resolution\n\n- Best combat system of any newer 4X I've played [b]by far[/b]. My God it's good. It's especially good if you like XCOM (it uses things like overwatch, cover, etc. for the tactics). Several points below outline why I think so.\n\n- Even if you hate the combat or XCOM, this game lets you auto-combat on a per battle basis if you want, and essentially sidestep the tactical combat if you dislike it or want to skip trivial fights, so you can ALSO play it as a pure empire building game if you wanted to. \n\n- Tactical battles allow you to re-watch what happened turn-by-turn even if you auto-combat, and also give you the option of RETRYING a fight without reloading the game, which is great! You can even pull up battle replays from the very beginning of the match at any time (say if you forgot what loadouts your enemy units were using). You can also pull out of combat before it starts if you're attacking with no penalty, movement or otherwise.\n\n- If you were a Heroes of Might and Magic 3 fan try this game and AOW3 out as well, they're the true spiritual successors to the legendary game itself IMO! Same strategic map / empire building / tactical combat balance.\n\n- Easy and unfrustrating save system, this thing saves my games automatically going back dozens of turns (in addition to regular save / quick save options), loading games is a nearly instantaneous for me. Taking back huge mistakes is a matter of 5 seconds.\n\n- Several races with their totally own style to choose from, several \"classes\" to choose from (called secret techs in this game, but same idea). Each combination plays / feels a lot different than the other ones, each mission felt like a new experience to me.\n\n- In addition to the usual racial and class-based units you'd expect, this game has an amazing \"mods\" (unit/hero upgrade) system, allowing you to upgrade and customize the loadout of every single unit and hero in your army. This means the game's combat has hundreds if not thousands of combinations and strategies in it that other games don't because they don't allow such deep flexibility. Facing a faction of sentient plants? Burn them by adding fiery lasers to your robots. Enemy stunning your robots too much with electric attacks? Add some +electricity resistance defense mods to your units. You get the idea.\n\n- Heroes can level up, get talents and switch out what weapons/gear they have. They can even talent into piloting and drive around in vehicles.\n\n- Units can level up (although they aren't as extreme as heroes). So a \"Veteran\" unit after several battles would be stronger than a unit you just trained. The \"prime\" top tier rank usually grants the units an additional, more powerful bonus than the weaker ones from the other ranks. You get rewarded for being good at fighting and being smart with units.\n\n- This game lets you research fast map movement speed and teleporters regardless of what race/class you are. A lot of games become a slog on super large maps without this.\n\n- Pretty good sound track and the racial announcers during fights make it sound exciting. \"Enemy OBLITERATED!\"\n\n- Tons of space / sci fi references if you're into that. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, but it has some seriously awesome lore and references of its own. The visual artwork is really solid too.\n\n- Founding colonies and exploiting resources: the actual \"empire building\" and research aspect of this game is solid and not overly punishing or boring.\n\n- Adventure on the map: visit exploration sites and curiosities on the map, fight monsters, gain treasure and items! Do quests for rewards too! (just like in heroes of might and magic). I felt like I was actually *doing interesting things* and being rewarded during the game instead of just passing turns for the empire building to complete.\n\n- Multiple ways to victory! Win by whatever play style you want, including: just murdering everyone else, becoming a diplomacy expert and \"peacefully\" winning, using a doomsday weapon, controlling the overwhelming majority of map sectors, or if you're in the campaign often just doing the quest lines.\n\nIn summary:\n\nThis game is one of the best there is in the genre right now as of Oct 2020, putting a particular emphasis on action and tactical combat, although still a very rewarding game even if auto-combated for all battles. The game is almost criminally underrated on steam right now and if you're looking to try a new 4X I think this game is a must try.", "timestamp_created": 1602125462, "timestamp_updated": 1602125789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 90, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.845752179622650146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "77192749": {"recommendationid": "77192749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006234442", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 324, "last_played": 1601130620}, "language": "english", "review": "It is one of those games that are nice and dandy, but have nothing that makes me come back to it \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nGlad I bought it on discount.\n\nGame is a mix of Heroes of Might and Magic and X-Com, however the X-Com part is very slight as it is more time efficient to do auto-battles skipping the whole X-Com part.\nThere is a LOT of researching and choices on development tree.\n\nI played wit with my nephew multiplayer online, and for starters I had bad experience connecting to game servers, after hour or two of troubleshooting I found out you have to disconnect steam account from game account for it to work, on my end.\nAfter we have finished 3h noob battle (both first time playing) till today this game left notification on my steam client saying that \"1 new turn waiting\" which is a lie.\n\nBuy it only on discount", "timestamp_created": 1602096644, "timestamp_updated": 1602096644, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "77183297": {"recommendationid": "77183297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048401917", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 8169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4553, "last_played": 1608097093}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall okay.

(the amazons are the easiest to spot since they ride on dinosaurs often whereas the others dont.)\n\nAnd whereas the previous game the combinations of race and class were more about synergy and hidden bonuses, this game is literally only about synergy when it comes to damage types. Every race has 2 damage types it uses - getting a hidden tech that corresponds and buffs said damage type so far seems to be the most viable combination - and since the hidden techs gives so little in terms on unique abilities to heroes and such i really dont see the point in choosing anything else.\n\nThere is also a severe lack of interesting locations or cool unique weapons/armor in the game. they made the entire \"rpg\" feel of the game EXTREMELY boring and monotone. unlike last game you can now equip regular units with gear - its a pretty basic inventory but they are just units so thats to be expected - the tradeoff? The heroes got the same treatment. The inventory is appalingly bland and boring compared to last installment.\n\nAnd then the basebuilding and zone-expanding.. this game gives you about 20 rounds before the AI's have blocked you off entirely from expanding. the whole zone system is disturbingly boring to deal with, since unlike last game its more math than fluid fun, and coupled with that the AI just use its borders to lock you within your own little enclosure just drains so much out of the game... You cant even declare war on them without MAJOR repurcussions from literally everyone on the map unless you have a reason. a reason, mind you - that the game decides for you.\n\nSpeaking of the declaration of war, why did it have to be so extremely clunky? just another tiny change for god knows what reason - but it did subtract from my fun atleast.\n\nAnd the spells. jesus christ, the spells. They were basic in the previous games, basic but fun - and I dont know how or why, but apparently - they needed to be even more basic. you have 2/2 spells per day left. oh, you used this shitty little spell, ah, subtract one point from your spell per day count. What was wrong with the mana system? this way there is no difference between a complete garbage spell and one spell you will use time and time again because its amazing. this was just a letdown altogether since mage was my favorite in the previous game.\n\nAnd then lastly the tech-tree. Now, this obviously is a subjective view, just like the rest of this review - but personally, being able to see literally all the stuff and what leads to what was just.. you guessed it - boring. it becomes less of a, what do i need now - do i wanna take the risk of teching my spell in hopes that the one i need shows up, or should i go with the safe-bet of researching better units - and more of a, ok, this goes there and that goes there and i want that one so i just have to go this tech-road for 135 turns, cool - lets do that. \n\nI guess as I type this its becoming more and more apparent that this does not feel like a game to me, it feels like a math-problem. Everything is so open and precise it removes the \"mystique\" from the game. Every AI will block you inside, every game with your favorite combination will be the same, every zone you encounter will be lackluster, every game will always end up with min-maxing, going the most efficient route etc - if you have played one game as Race X and hidden tech X you have played them all.\n\nThis game is boring. and I truly wish it wasn't. Good thing Age of Wonders 3 still exist.\n\nAs a final PS: I did use some hyperbole here, there are some elements of mystique and randomness, but to me - you pretty much saw what the game had to offer after 10 hours, and the later 40 felt like a forced slog. ive uninstalled this game more times than ive started it up because the thought of playing it literally bores me, this however is the case for me, it might not be for you.

Time to decide whether to refund this game!\n\nI have to admit it is not an easy decision.  This game should almost not be called \"Age of Wonders\".  \"Age of XCOM\" would be more accurate.  The game has been stripped - STRIPPED I TELL YOU - of all the charm and sweetness that has made me want to play the Age of Wonders series.  No this is some sort of gorilla of a game.\n\nAll the unicorns are gone now... and they have been replaced by T-Rex.  So I really hesitate keeping this.\n\nThe tiniest inkling of a redeeming quality that Age of Wonders: Planetfall has to offer - it is really pitiful.  To strip a game of the romance and warmth that its fantasy predecessor provided, to become a heartless tactical bloodbath that has been brought to the table - and then say \"oh but you can manufacture new units that have specials they obtained in the field\" - to do this is really a crime against the player base.  PLEASE ADD THIS FEATURE TO THE BASE GAME AOW3.  But instead this is the only place to find this feature.\n\nSo this game is allegedly \"prettier\" than AoW3 (at least some people say that).  And this game has a more interesting technology tree.  Yeah I can see it's slightly more interesting.\n\nBut for Pete's sake.  You got rid of unicorns!  WHY?  You're trying to tell me there are no unicorns in space?  Give me a break!  If they could fit on Noah's ark they can fit on that space-can and make the world wonderful again!\n\nThe other oh-so-slightly redeeming quality: some of the old AoW3 races have modern counterparts here, such as Dwarves.  Only here they are called Dvar.  Whatever.\n\nNot only are the races and units different - the UI is also sterilized in the name of \"spaaaace!\"  It almost makes me want to barf.  AoW3 was FAITHFUL to the earlier AoW games - and this?  This is a sneering bastard-child.  I really don't know why I'm keeping it - other than \"units can be manufactured\" thing and this meekly little hope that I'll find other redeeming qualities.  For now it feels like quite a risk.\n\nAnd I just found out... no underground layers!!  UGH!  I LOVE playing underground!  I made a map that was inspired by the 7 layers of hell - but no multiple layers here.  How are you supposed to play Dwarves without underground?!\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/718850/discussions/0/1643170269583134244/\n\n\nBut the point is - I will keep this.  At least for another day or two...  Hopefully I can bring myself to play a decent amount.  118 minutes barely scratches the surface.

For me, this used to be the better version of Heroes of Might and Magic. There are things I really like in Planetfall, but the things against are too serious for me to enjoy it the way I enjoyed the previous games.\n\nThe good\nIf you played the previous games, at the beginning you will probably have an impression that the combat has been improved. Maps feature a lot of destructable elements that explode doing damage and adding status effects to units within one hex radius. These are not gimmicks, but meaningful combat factors that you may want to exploit to tilt the scales in your favor. Many ranged units have directional overwatch like in Gears: Tactics, which allows you to dig-in and fire at the enemy when he enters your range on his round. You have a free action to rotate your units so they do not end up flanked at the end of their movement. Each unit has action points that are spent on movement, attacks and abilities, giving you a better idea of the actions you have left. Every colony automatically starts with a garrison that you cannot move and is not visible on the map, you can improve the tier of the defending units by purchasing military infrastructure (like buildings), and you can also add units that you have moving on the map like in the previous AoWs. Improving military infrastructure also unlocks the production of turrets, which can also be upgraded. Defending such a fortress can be very entertaining. Heroes have skills, equipment and mods, and they can also drive vehicles. All units also have access to 3 mod slots, which can dramatically change their effectiveness. When preparing for battle, you are provided with some combined numbers on the strength of the attacking/defending army, making it easier to decide whether you want an automatic or tactical battle. The scenery for tactical battles is varied and pleasant to the eye. The soundtrack was made by Michiel Van Den Bos, the legend that made a lot of music for the first Unreal Tournament, and I had the track Wave of Hostility on repeat on my PC for an hour. Diplomacy has been significantly improved, even if you just play to kill every other enemy on the map. Diplomacy points are a resource that you gather over time and as a result of your actions and can spend e.g. to instantly purchase unique units and technology from neutral factions scattered on the map, you can ask them to vacate a strategically important location, and to prod them to perform certain activities. When you accelerate the production of units, you no longer have to wait 1 turn for the production to finish - it happens instantly. You can only do this once in a turn, but this often is a game changer anyway. The map features environmental hazards that add variety, affect all armies and can be removed if you have the appropriate resources. The tech tree is alright, separated into military and social upgrades that develop simultaneously. They unlock what you would expect to unlock, units, map and diplomatic abilities, improved resource gathering, mods, combat \"magic\", etc.\n\nThe bad\nYou may have noticed I haven't written anything positive about empire building. That's because I don't believe it has been changed for the better. The map is divided into sectors that yield specific resources depending on the type of terrain. They can also provide additional bonuses if you clear neutral factions guarding specific locations which may or may not be in a given sector. The sectors do not increase their sphere of influence as time goes by, and you can only annex adjacent sectors once your colonies gain enough population. You can build new colonies only in a single specific spot in every sector, and you cannot have colonies in adjacent sectors, they need to be at least one sector (annexed or not) between them. All in all you feel you have far less control over your state, to the point it almost seems you are autopiloting this aspect of the game. Forget about clustering cities, enthusiastically looking for the best spot to construct a new settlement to reap the best possible benefits. It's all very simplistic and unentertaining. The map looks bland, the colors are odd, it doesn't really encourage you to explore. The idle animations are alright, but many other are hideous. I mean, literally, go to YouTube and look at the jump attacks of units, or how jets crash into the ground, this stuff is straight from the second generation of consoles. The story is a joke. It starts strong, setting the right tone, like a sci-fi classic - an army returns home after cryo-sleep for 2 hundred years - seems exciting. Then, in the first mission, you run around in the search of a \"pleasure bot\" that the human leaders of the warring factions want to *uck, cause you want to earn their respect/blackmail them. I'm not kidding, this is the \"quest\". They lost me after this and my friend and I just stick to the multiplayer. Speaking of which, this is a classic Paradox game. Sometimes you get kicked out every second turn or so, sometimes the game cannot connect to the servers, sometimes it quits and says it had a desync. The only improvement to multiplayer is that the saves are stored online automatically and you can rejoin quickly. They know they can't make multiplayer properly so they literally made a system that makes it easier to reconnect. That's foresight, right there.\n\nAll that would be bearable, hell, even expected from a Paradox game, but the thing that completely destroys it is the XCOM-like RNG. In combat, all units now have % chance to hit, with the possibilities of full damage, graze, or miss. This is different than in the previous AoW, where you would always hit, maybe for 1 point of damage, but you would. Why is this an issue? Because you have situations when the enemy will shoot you for full damage from 6 hexes away, when he has two obstacles on the way to you, and you are standing behind cover in an elevated area in your fortress. At the same time, you will do less damage or completely miss a unit standing in the open with one hex between you. Just last game, a tier II gunship, shooting from above missed a tier I unit standing on the adjacent hex below. The randomness is atrocious, even more so because it seems so one-sided. I don't know what they did to the AI but on normal difficulty they will hurt you far more frequently than you will, and that's with low-tier units, very often to the point that you having cover is completely irrelevant for the AI. Some tier I units are op af. You get tier I critters that attack three times with a chain lightning-like beam that jumps around all adjacent units. As I said, at the beginning combat seems very captivating and exciting, but after 20 hours of playing you peel off the surface and see the rotten core. It's broken, it's frustrating and it's bad design. We will probably keep playing it a bit more, after all, I have enjoyed the series for 20 years, I will see if my opinion changes on this one, but I already stalled writing this review hoping for I don't know what.

There are some interesting elements of the stories and factions you play as. But, overall the story did not interest me.\n\nThe gameplay is just as you'd expect from a 4x game. You explore, exploit areas for resources, expand your control over the planets and exterminate your enemies. From a campaign map and strategy game standpoint the mechanics are fine. I think the gameplay lacks in the combat. The combat goes for more of an XCOM type of approach but falls short in this area. I found myself auto fighting all the combat portions.\n\nVisuals are alright. Nothing too spectacular. The terrain and design of the different planets are a bonus and keep things looking and feeling fresh. The music is good albeit there was only one song playing during the campaign.\n\nThere is a decent level of replayability with this game as there are a ton of factions and different ways of achieving victory in the campaigns. \n\nThe game runs flawlessly.\n\nOverall, Age of Wonders: Planetfall is not a bad game by any stretch. For fans of 4x this is a good option. But, if you are looking for a strategy game this would not be my first recommendation. For players new to strategy and 4x games I would pass on this game until a little more comfortable with the genre.

In fact those are all genres that I haven't had a lot of experience in until recently. I'm very much a novice. And from my perspective as a novice, this game is amazing. It is challenging but has a pretty smooth learning curve. You get a lengthy tutorial and then a practice planet before you start story mode. (At 10 hours game time I'm still playing the practice planet.) So I'd say the game has done a pretty good job of teaching me what I need to know. But I will give you one hint that took me forever to figure out: When another faction or race gives you a quest and you're wondering where to go, just scroll around the map until you see a trophy cup. That's the quest location. I wish someone had told me that at the beginning of the game. Would have saved me a lot of time.\n\nAnyway, if you want to play a game that's like Civilization but set on alien worlds and has a strong focus on strategic battles and has a gorgeous soundtrack, Planetfall is an excellent choice.

I played all of them when they were available. At first, I didn't like Planetfall because I didn't like the space setting compared to high fantasy the series were known for. But as I gave more chances to game,I started to like it.\nCombat is a strict improvement. Thanks to unit mods, every unit has their place in combat. Even the lowest ranking units with right mods can be effective at late game. Spellcasting is also kind of restricted,so you can't overwhelm enemies with spells alone. Every unit has numerous active and passive abilities,and race class combinations are more fleshed out in this sense. \nEmpire and city management is much more detailed. They draw the inspiration from Endless Legends and Civilizations games. It's still not as deep as those because AoW is more about tactical combat. They will probably add more to this area later on.\nMusic and artstyle are okay-ish. Nothing great but nothing bad. Visuals fall a bit short of what I expected at this year tbh. Game definitely needs new tracks tho. Music gets repetitive after a while. Sound effects could be better aswell. \nDiplomacy is not that deep but it has more to it than previous games. I never needed to be a diplomatic juggler even on hardest difficulties. Game becomes a bit easy after you grasp it's mechanics. There's also workshop support which is always a good thing.\nAll in all,I like this game now.

The maps are covered in detail, foliage, natural formations, and more that really bring the areas to life. [url=https://store.steampowered.com/developer/triumphstudios]Triumph Studio's[/url] Art Team deserves high praise as the characters, creatures, and units are all beautiful as well. The visuals, paired with a soothing soundtrack (albeit it can get repetitive after tens of hours), make playing and listening to the game a wonderful experience. So where does the game fall short?\n\nTo be honest it's hard for me to really pinpoint where [i]Age of Wonders: Planetfall[/i] missed the mark, but I'm leaning toward the combat. The different factions feel a little stereotypical and rely on many genre tropes. Each faction excels at a different aspect of the game's mechanics, and they tend to make sense and tie into the lore and history of the factions well enough. The combat is similar to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/200510/XCOM_Enemy_Unknown/]XCOM: Enemy Unknown[/url] but not nearly as polished. Even after 50 hours, I found myself struggling to understand the best way to move and position my units to maximize damage. One example is when units with an assault rifle could attack three times at 50% accuracy, but if moved to a flank position with 95% accuracy, all of a sudden that unit will only fire one time for a third of the damage. It was hidden mechanics like this that really made the combat frustrating, instead of fun (like [i]XCOM[/i]) and basically forced me to always auto-resolve combat with overwhelming force.\n\nThe diplomacy mechanics were well done. You have some additional options compared to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/594570/Total_War_WARHAMMER_II/]Total War: WARHAMMER II[/url] with the ability to trade territories, but the mechanics are not as nearly fleshed out as [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/779340/Total_War_THREE_KINGDOMS/]Total War: THREE KINGDOMS[/url]. \n\nReplayability is great if you enjoy the game. You can create custom sized maps with your choice of number of other AI players and friends. Performance was outstanding. Playing the game at the highest settings at 4K, I always stayed int he 50-60 fps range. \n\nOverall, I have to say I'm a little disappointed by [i]Age of Wonders: Planetfall[/i]. Not to say I didn't enjoy it, I just wish it had something more unique about it that made me want to play it over something else. It's not a bad game, and certainly not a bad strategy game, but there are many other available options that are far superior in my opinion such as [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/594570/Total_War_WARHAMMER_II/]Total War: WARHAMMER II[/url] or [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/779340/Total_War_THREE_KINGDOMS/]Total War: THREE KINGDOMS[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1598959676, "timestamp_updated": 1599272018, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47999998927116394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1599033673, "developer_response": "Hey WallaWallas, thank you for your review and we're sorry to hear you didn't enjoy Age of Wonders: Planetfall. \n\nI would like to address your experience with Tactical Combat. During Tactical Combat units have 3 Action Points they can spend on movement and abilities. When you have a unit selected you'll see a grid of four colours (green, blue, purple and red) on the map, these colours indicate how many Action Points will be removed by moving into that section. While moving in the green area no AP is removed, 1 AP is removed when moving into the blue section, 2 AP when moving into the purple section and 3/All AP is removed when moving into the Red area. Additionally, Action Points can be removed through status effects and stagger. If you move into the Overwatch view of another unit and they have a ability that can stagger, you can end up losing an additional AP on top of the AP required to move.\n\nIn your example you're using a Repeating ability, meaning it will fire as many times as the unit has AP. If the unit fired only once either of the following scenario's might have occured:\n[list]\n[*] You moved the unit from it's starting position into the Purple section which requires 2 AP to achieve.\n[*] You moved the unit from it's starting position into the Blue section which requires 1 AP to achieve, but moved into a enemies overwatch range and got hit with a stagger ability resulting in the removal of another AP.\n[/list]\n\nHopefully this cleared up some of the issues you had with Tactical Combat and provided new insights.\n\nWith Regards,\nJordi"}, "75230906": {"recommendationid": "75230906", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982803252", "num_games_owned": 421, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 174, "last_played": 1568107283}, "language": "english", "review": "Meh", "timestamp_created": 1598893931, "timestamp_updated": 1598893931, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470531851053237915", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "75221060": {"recommendationid": "75221060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073004893", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8272, "last_played": 1615749938}, "language": "english", "review": "Space Russian Dwarves vs Amazons riding dinosaurs", "timestamp_created": 1598881238, "timestamp_updated": 1598881238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "75183217": {"recommendationid": "75183217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041180412", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 13689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6910, "last_played": 1611446295}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed this game, fun story with interesting gameplay that has really good unit/faction diversity.", "timestamp_created": 1598814587, "timestamp_updated": 1598814587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "75159237": {"recommendationid": "75159237", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970954630", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 48412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "playtime_at_review": 7973, "last_played": 1618491616}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm enjoying this much more than AoW3.

So I tried it and I enjoy civilisations. This is a sci-fi skinned civilisations. Some of the combat mechanics and unit interactions are intriguingly different and fun to play with. It's also a very colourful game with nice graphics. \nThe main things I was thinking while playing was: \n- That the research trees were a little silly. The abilities I could unlock were very mild variations of each other and I could unlock the second level of things before unlocking the first (maybe i'm dumb and there's super important stuff I ignored and played fine without).\n- The NPC factions were annoying. It was cool to get quests from them at the start cause it gave a little life to the world. A little goal. Then it was like every 7-8 turns they demanded absurd amounts of resources or another little quest. If you don't do them they hate you quickly. It was fine until I was bored of constantly running around trying to keep them happy, which happened quickly.\n- The combat was fine but I gave up after so many times where I tried planning my attacks for ages just to right click to like \"cancel the attack\" so I could move to a better position just to attack the ground or jump to nowhere. It was also stupid how often my creatures would miss in manual combat but if I made sure my combat score was moderately higher than the opponent, I was likely to not lose creatures during auto attacks.\n- \"Why does the helpful tips lady keep starting over. Shut up already.\" Maybe she's the reason my understanding of the majority of the mechanics is from trial and error cause that got annoying af real quick.\n- I researched \"resurrect hero\", primed it, launched it and I still have no idea how you bring a hero back because I couldn't use that ability in any way that made sense to me. I also researched a nuke. Used it. Reloaded so I could use it when I actually needed to use a nuke and then couldn't use it when I thought was the right time for no reason that I understood.\n- The types of damage, the classifications for units, and the way those interacted didn't make any sense to me.\n\nThe introduction was about a void and didn't set up a story that compelled me. I would suggest going for XCOM if you like the look of this turn based combat and certainly civs if you like turn based empire building.

That should tell you how much I have enjoyed this. For people who played the older AoW games, this takes a little time to get used to. The tutorial should do just nicely. People who are used to other 4Xs should also enjoy this, but for people used to not-really-4X games like Firaxis' XCOM (or even the super good old classic UFO:Enemy Unknown, TFTD and Apocalypse games) this is NOT what you're looking for, tho you may still enjoy it. It's Civ-like, not a pure base and personnel management game.\n\nWhat Civ lacked that any game in the AoW series offer is tactical combat, which you may want to go ahead and just ignore if you so wish via Auto combat (which actually plays a tactical battle instead of just doing some random rolls for the result, and you can view how the AI conducted the battle for you and then choose to be satisfied with the result, or take over and just replay the battle yourself if you didn't like the result).\n\nI've played all the previous AoWs, finished the campaigns for AoWs I and II and their expansions, but only did it halfway for AoW III. This was because I wanted AoW more for its multiplayer enjoyment. AoW:PF does not disappoint if you play this hotseat with your friends BUT the new server-based online multiplayer system in AoW:PF (as opposed to Peer-to-Peer style for AoW III, which I played with my overseas and local friends) is clunky and still very buggy even at the time of writing (August 2020) and players should play their own turns and log out before the next player takes over. The out-of-sync issues are seriously very very nasty.\n\nThis being said, this is seriously enjoyable and I highly recommend this to AoW fans; and a word of advice: DON'T think that just because this is SF instead of Fantasy that this is passable for you.", "timestamp_created": 1597205491, "timestamp_updated": 1597205491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "74145103": {"recommendationid": "74145103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043471400", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 10921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6223, "last_played": 1610656954}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun sci-fi strategy with a heavy focus on tactical warfare, and very little base-building. It's basically the opposite of Civ. There are multiple factions, secret techs, tactical ops, and countless upgrades, all of which combine to offer [i]obscene[/i] amounts of customization. There's honestly so many choices that it's overwhelming, maybe even excessive, but giving more options to players is never a bad thing in my book.\n\nThe best part is the combat, which is comparable to Xcom or Shadowrun. You need to use cover, positioning, and crowd-control in order to win most fights. Dishing out the most damage isn't always the best strategy, as even low-threat enemies can focus-fire one or two of your soldiers before you wipe them all out. On the other hand, once you get the hang of things, you can take down enemies who far outrank you in terms of sheer military power.\n\nFinally, this is no doubt a multiplayer game. The single-player campaign is mainly a tutorial, with only two missions per faction, and playing a match with the AI is just boring.

Planetfall came with humble monthly, kicking it from the top of my 250+ WL. \n\nI'm an old AOW fan from their first games that brought me plenty of joy -- and be a very rare actual success of following MoM. And the whole line kept to the excellent standard.  If you are into this genre I suggest to get all those old games, they are still better than most what came after.  The design manages to collect the best parts of other games and make a good mix on both thematic and technical level. And even manage to add some unique elements.\n\nPF also builds on top of many other games, and maybe not even have a unique this time around -- but this does not make it bad or lacking.  As the ingredient games (most notable probably SMAC and the new XCOM) had serious problems  gameplay-wise.  So the innovation was mostly wasted.  Not here.  \nLet's see what you have:\n - a single-planet 4X as the core with economy based on sectors rather than small cells and colonies instead of cities\n - falling on the lighter side with city improvements and more on tech tree, also trying to go against much micromanagement\n - many different factions with their special approach, units and special techs\n - unit system with prototypes, hero leaders, unit mods, XP gain. army size limited to 6 but battle dragging in all surrounding hexes\n - tactical and strategic ops replacing the spells \n - rich tactical battles on a big map with terrain, functional but destructible cover, and extreme variety of things at your fingertips. and finally thinking about players: you can repeat the battle from the exit screen if figured out better tactics, also auto-resolve can be watched and turned into manual after the fact. No need to waste saves/loads on that. \n - world generated with locations, NPC races, barbarians\n - good diplomacy system and NPC quests \n - beyond the sandbox there is campaign and multiplayer\n - the art and the score is beautiful\n\nOn the other side there are some crashes (the autosave rescues most of what you do) and potential balance issues -- the game is maybe a year old and got plenty of patches addressing issues, I expect more to come. \n\nI didn't play enough to tell about the thing most important to me: reasonably playing AI, but this far did not encounter a major blunder and didn't see comments about that, so I keep the hopes up.  For reasonable play on high challenge level I'll certainly need to learn a lot about the details, \n\nTLDR: looks like on of the best current offerings in the genre, if you read to this far, just go and obtain it.", "timestamp_created": 1597079771, "timestamp_updated": 1597079771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54977869987487793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "74036271": {"recommendationid": "74036271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105652542", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 2667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1863, "last_played": 1599896422}, "language": "english", "review": "Needs work.", "timestamp_created": 1596988913, "timestamp_updated": 1596988913, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451104104518890381", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "74034423": {"recommendationid": "74034423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054218187", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 87985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32292, "last_played": 1612084438}, "language": "english", "review": "One of those hidden gem games.\n\nThats my favourite 4x strategy game for now.", "timestamp_created": 1596986567, "timestamp_updated": 1596986567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569518923759460449", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "74024873": {"recommendationid": "74024873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005019302", "num_games_owned": 876, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 165, "last_played": 1596958246}, "language": "english", "review": "It's alright - 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1596973274, "timestamp_updated": 1596973274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "74023125": {"recommendationid": "74023125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065875949", "num_games_owned": 1628, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 844, "last_played": 1597501647}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish it was more about empire building and less about combat.", "timestamp_created": 1596970543, "timestamp_updated": 1596970543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51691281795501709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73994646": {"recommendationid": "73994646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079882607", "num_games_owned": 652, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1596921326}, "language": "english", "review": "Can be described in three words: Generic, Uninspired, Boring. \nThe combat is the only redeeming factor, but xcom does it better.", "timestamp_created": 1596921303, "timestamp_updated": 1596921303, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499341785907745361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73987815": {"recommendationid": "73987815", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960700750", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 15676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 893, "last_played": 1615604263}, "language": "english", "review": "BEES.

I've only played the base campaigns; this review does not extend to the DLC gameplay or generic scenario maps. Before you start playing, you should know you can speed up map movement on both strategic and tactical layers from the game options - you'll want to very soon even into your first campaign,\n\nPros:\n+ Playing well tactically can let you pull off victories that the army balance would say are impossible, and it feels really satisfying when you do. Accuracy and cover work in interesting ways, and it's sometimes worth it to take shots at 15% hit chance. Additionally, the support skill system is fun to use, though it doesn't feel very well balanced.\n+ Strategically, exploring new worlds is enjoyable, as is growing your colonies and setting up defenses and transport nodes in anticipation of what your enemies will do.\n+ Decent graphics, light but pleasant lore. Some of the voice acting doesn't fit at times, but it's almost comical when that happens, like a golden radio voice telling me about mass genocide in an upbeat tone.\n+ Moment-to-moment gameplay almost always keeps you on your toes. I had a hard time putting down the game mid-map; there was always one more place to raid or army to fight.\n+ Lots of ways to customize your units, allowing for different tactical strategies. Sometimes you'll end up preferring tier 1 bonuses that give a very niche effect even if the overall stats are lower compared to tier 4 alternatives, just because you're going for a certain playstyle. \n+ Also, the fact that your main heroes are campaign-persistent is nice. On the downside, that did make me end up grinding already-won maps so I could have a power start in the next.\n+ Great, memorable soundtrack. Parts of it reminds me of Westwood game soundtracks, while the rest feels like an 80s sci-fi action movie. Really solid, unique feel.\n+ Even though I didn't play MP, I like the idea that you can log off while waiting for turns and get notified when yours starts. Given how long turns can take, I wouldn't like to have to wait for possibly an hour, so I felt like this might be worth mentioning for those who do want to play online.\n+ I like that you can defeat an enemy by taking out their main commander and their capital, as opposed to having to spend a lot of time conquering each individual settlement and defeating each army. Outmaneuvering them is rewarded.\n\nIt's not without some flaws, though:\n- The turn timer gets really long past turn 50 or so, and not always for good reason. In one case, there were only a few dozen NPC armies left and two factions that did nothing but turtle. It probably boiled down to trying to find options when they were severely limited in what they could do, but it was frustrating.\n- In the early game, losing any units at all is very punishing, which leads to a tendency to repeat battles a lot, which ends up being tedious.\n- Tying into my previous point, the tactical AI doesn't understand attrition very well. It won't use choke points, nor keep melee units back to allow your ranged units to bait and punish. Additionally, if you have a lot of army support skills, it will spam them in favor of actually killing enemies. It does sometimes set up overwatch traps on defense maps, but only if it \"feels\" you can't hit them with anything. You can break it using a support skill and they won't retry.\n- The strategic AI sometimes plays in very unnatural ways. It might just be bias, but it feels like when I'm attacked they show up with a doomstack at my border, but they'll be at war with an ally for ages and never move back and forth more than one settlement.\n- There's lots of variety in tactical support skills and espionage operations, but it doesn't feel like most of them are meaningful or worth the cost compared to alternatives.\n- You can find yourself in a real slog with progress in the last 1/3 of some campaigns. There is one specific Syndicate map with lots of water and teleporters that was a particular nightmare.\n\nThe tutorial could be a bit better about explaining some core concepts - such as: \n1. you should take your scout units from your first stacks and send them out to explore right from turn 1, \n2. almost every colony needs at least the first military defense upgrade to survive random marauders, unless you clear their spawners out, which you won't probably have the time for\n3. you should almost always focus on NPC faction quests in the early game and save up influence to buy a stack from them as your 2nd/3rd army\n4. having an air unit raider stack can be a very powerful strategy, as they can cross water and mountains very fast and let you do precision strikes\n5. before finishing a campaign, kit out your main commander with the best stuff you can get that would work against tier 1 or 2 units, as you'll be using them to clear out the early and mid game for the next campaign\n6. when picking new sectors, cosmite is usually the most important to get, followed by influence, followed by everything else. Also, you can talk to friendly NPC faction armies to get them off of occupied resource points - I didn't know this for quite some time.\n\nAll in all, I had a good time, and I would recommend the game to people who enjoy Civ-style games but would like more control over their units. I've played a lot of XCOM, and I wouldn't agree the tactical gameplay is all that similar, but it does feel good for the most part.", "timestamp_created": 1595768560, "timestamp_updated": 1595768941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879173159599304199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73309332": {"recommendationid": "73309332", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991279501", "num_games_owned": 628, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1606265543}, "language": "english", "review": "It is AGE OF WONDERS:Planet Fall, I love this series always have since I was little fellow, playing on my old ass computer....of course those were in the fantasy days of the game, elves...gnomes,brownies....now we are in space baby...move the fuck over space RTS games, this one is here and it is subjugating all of you...", "timestamp_created": 1595767676, "timestamp_updated": 1595767676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73284258": {"recommendationid": "73284258", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993273145", "num_games_owned": 621, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 676, "last_played": 1596924836}, "language": "english", "review": "Heroes of Might and Magic + Civilization + XCOM", "timestamp_created": 1595721269, "timestamp_updated": 1595721269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73236978": {"recommendationid": "73236978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071093194", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 12012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4671, "last_played": 1605335482}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty sure one of the best Strategy game out there along with the turn based combat which combine XCOM combat system and the empire building like Civilization VI.

All settings were maxed out except AA.\n\nPLEASE NOTE, even though I have left comments on, I am not interested in you telling me that I should put 4000 hours into a game I don't enjoy so I can \"git good\", and then I would like it. That is a stupid argument. Don't be stupid. Skill is not indicative of enjoyment, and I have better things to do than bash my head on what I personally feel are bad / mediocre games on the off chance I could maybe like them one day.

Think something like a JRPG that insists on renaming Magic to Xxyyzzxx (but not Xxyzzxx, because that's the evil faction. Better memorise the difference!) because they think that it makes the world lore deeper somehow. It doesn't.\n- The environment is a jumbled mass of tiles and doesn't communicate much to the player.\n- The interface is cluttered as hell and poorly designed with layer upon layer and little to rely on to figure it out except rote memorisation.\n- The voice acting sometimes reads things and sometimes doesn't. Often I found it would just stop in the middle of a sentence.\n- The tutorial is straight up awful at teaching you the game. An example:\nGame: \"All you have to do is click the hyper space drive cohesion unit (or some space gibberish).\"\nMe: \"What and where the hell is that? And for what reason?\"\nGame: *SHRUGS*\nMe: Looks at all the tooltips for the hundred icons on the screen and becoming increasingly annoyed.\nGame: \"Oh crap, did you click something?

Overall, this is a unique experience that can still be a lot of fun despite its imperfections.\n\nLikes\no\tExperience is divided amongst units at the end of battle. Big improvement since experience could be over-farmed in former AoE games.\no\tModding units allows for more unit customization.\no\tGreat themes. Each civilization is interesting with unique benefits.\no\tCities are much more customizable, allowing players to modify their economy to fit their sitation.\no\tTactical combat is strategic and gritty.\n\nDislikes\no\tExperience is capped. In other AoW games, units would continue to get experience though with diminishing returns.\no\tUnit levels don\u2019t give interesting perks. Getting a unit to gold experience usually gave some sort of game changing ability or trait in other AoE games that allowed weaker units to scale into late game.\no\tUnit movement on the global map is mostly the same for units. In other AoE games, there were benefits and drawbacks for mobile armies of calvary versus strong, slow armies. Now it mostly only matters what kind of terrain is traversed rather than a unit\u2019s base value for movement.\no\tCaptured NPC factions you are at war with can be annexed and cannot be migrated. Diminishes the theme.\n\nBugs \u2013 Nothing game breaking but still mentionable.\no\tSometimes enemy units in tactical combat take about 60 seconds to move. This is rare, but sometimes an AI controlled unit seems to \u201csit and think\u201d for a while before moving.\no\tModels of units getting blasted in overwatch will not always appear on the correct square after ending the turn.

If you find Civilizations too complicated or X-Com too difficult and want to combine those games with some mild RPG elements in a very colorful and slick setting, you'll enjoy it. If you're looking for something deeper or more complex, look elsewhere.\n\n4X Gameplay: Essentially Civ 6 with fewer build options, restricted city founding locations, fewer resources, etc. Your cities generate Energy, production (just like civ 6), research (just like civ 6), and food (just like civ 6) each turn. You can expand cities by annexing adjacent zones and building expansion buildings on them (just like districts in civ 6). There's a very small research tree (just like civ 6) which essentially unlocks units and unit upgrades. You get the idea. Each faction only has about 8 units in total.\n\nCombat: I haven't played X-Com, but this is exactly like what I expect a dumbed-down X-Com is like. The maps are colorful but not that varied. They are small  and everything on them can basically be classified as A: Cover, B: LoS blocker, C: Something that explodes and damages adjacent hexes. Battles typically last no more than 3 turns, which is good because you'll be fighting a lot of battles against AI units roaming the map, and every battle is pretty much the same, so by the time you finish the tutorial, you've basically seen it all. Each unit in your army has a basic attack and 1 or 2 special abilities which are typically one use per battle. Some units can set overwatch, most can't. There's some basic tactical elements like cover and flanking, but don't expect too much.\n\nRPG: After gaining experience from combat, you can level up your heroes with a variety of abilities that mostly boil down to +X% to accuracy/damage/etc. on your hero, or +X% to your army. There's some extremely shallow RPG elements involved with interacting with NPC factions, but it pretty much boils down to \"declare war\" or \"do quest to defeat enemy stack X or collect some amount of resource Y in exchange for reputation\".\n\nIn summary, this game is colorful, slick, and polished. There's a number of factions with a unique flair, but by the time you finish the tutorial campaign, you've seen about all there is to see in the game. If you find other games too complicated or you just want something very casual, this game will do good for you. However, to those used to Paradox's other 4X titles like Stellaris, this game will leave you feeling underwhelmed.\n\nIf you like deep 4x games: Get Civilization 6 or Stellaris instead.\nIf you like deep turn based tactical squad combat: Get Battletech or X-Com instead.\nIf you like deep turn based adventure RPGs: Not my lane, but I'm sure there's better games for that too.", "timestamp_created": 1593475027, "timestamp_updated": 1593475027, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456866145133972168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "71684580": {"recommendationid": "71684580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066322371", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1594333877}, "language": "english", "review": "Not bad", "timestamp_created": 1593466481, "timestamp_updated": 1593466481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014469861984253", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "71669926": {"recommendationid": "71669926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014235983", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3757, "last_played": 1605131357}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Sparkling[/h1]\n\nWhat I like about this game is that its full nice visuals and gamemechanics.

I was wary at first as I was pretty awful at AoW 3 and wasn't sure what to expect but I was gifted a Steam Voucher from the Missus and promptly took the plunge into Planetfall.

The attention and level of detail of the graphics, the excellent music score, the amount of units, the ability to mod said units and a plethora of other fine touches make this a visual feast.  The tactical battles look gorgeous and seem to be randomly generated terrain features every time, I am not 100% on that but it appears that way as I can't say I have seen any two battlefields look exactly the same.\n\nI have played a few of the races available and loved every one of them after learning the little nuances that each have and couple that with a choice of secret technology you have plenty options for customising your army and the Commander. I must admit the Vanguard seem my favourite so far closely followed by the Dvar.\n\nI have sunk a fair few hours into this title in a short time frame as I was hopelessly addicted to the gameplay in minutes.  The in-game encyclopedia helps explain everything and you can spend a fair bit of time just reading up on the items, abilities, races and such like. There is so much to dive into you may not come up for air when you should!\n\nI must stress that I don't feel I am particularly good at this game but I can still set the options for victory conditions and how aggressive the AI is so my games tend to be long, winding roads to an alliance victory which is what I like.

Ultimately i'm not recommending it it because I doesn't really do anything better than it's competetors, and I can't think of a good reason to play this over TW or Civ. \n\nOn the one hand, it's not an objectively bad game, there are good elements\n- It looks great! There are some really cool units and the maps all look amazing.\n- The UI is clean and attractive presents info well - not often the case in this type of game\n- It has a load of content variety, different creatures, types of ammo, powers etc (though this doesn't necessarily translate well into gameplay variety)\n- The systems do a great job of carrying you through the game and giving you that 'one more turn' drug. I did play it till 3 several days in a row.\n\nBut these things are outweighed by the bad\n- The campaign gameplay is comparatively very linear. Unlike Civ, you don't feel like there are many different ways to play a game. The management systems are fairly sparse so it's hard to specialise, and go tall or wide, or shoot for a diplomatic victory. Maybe you can if you are really pro - but the fact the game didn't communicate this to me in nearly 20 hours of gameplay is not good. Unlike TW, it lacks the extreme differences across factions and start positions.\n- The battle systems are also pretty linear. It's turn based, and there is a load of unit customisation, which games like X-com have shown can lead to massive variety. Unfortunately, due to the very basic design of the battlefields and the hugely long ranges, it's very hard to mix things up and feel smart. \n- This is more nebulous - but I just didn't feel engaged. My choices didn't feel that consequential, so I just drifted through my games. I was addictively taking turns but I felt pretty empty afterwards.

Overseers drove them on, adding psyonic blasts from their staffs to the Indentured's firepower and occasionally using their neural override protocol to force a unit to run farther or fight harder.  Slinking from cover to cover, hooded Assassins sniped at any enemy that dared poke their head over the wall.\n\nBehind the infantry came the vehicles of House Atredies; sleek silver hovercraft with smooth lines and beautiful sails.  Though they resembled the pleasure craft used by many noble houses for travel across the planet's surface, they were very much built for war:  Heavy armor and shields protected them and their crews from enemy fire, and as they advanced, they blasted at the enemy with powerful psionic cannons that could break minds and bodies alike.\n\nSulemar watched as his Indentured brought down a large Vanguard Walker with their arc rifles.  It froze up as the arc energy overloaded its systems, then toppled over with an earth-shaking crash.  His men cheered and he nodded in satisfaction at the new power his infantry could bring to bear.  \n\nHis scientists really had done a wonderful job upgrading his troops\u2019 weapons.  Not only had their power output increased, but every shot that hit its target would jump to several nearby enemy units, electrocuting them as well as the target.  With this power, his men were scything through the Vanguard's mechs and tanks, the blue arc energy frying their circuits.  It also appeared to work well enough against fleshy targets, he thought as he watched a squad of Vanguard troops get gunned down by the Indentured, their bodies spasming as the shock coursed through their power armor and nervous systems.\n\nHe felt a pang of pity as he watched the soldiers die and shook his head sadly.  It was a shame, really, that House Atredies and the 113th Vanguard Expeditionary Corps had come to blows.  They'd both been dispatched centuries ago to colonize Arrakis for the Star Union, only to emerge from cryostasis and discover that the Star Union had long ago collapsed for reasons unknown and they had no contact with any outside planets.  \n\nWithout the means for another interstellar voyage, they both made planetfall on Arrakis and set about establishing civilizations.  There were hardships, of course; reactivated Reaper nests that spawned homicidal robots, former Star Union nobility who'd degenerated into insane technocultists, pirates, monsters, and many more dangers.\n\nThere were also more familiar faces, ones he knew from the happier days of the Star Union; the biology-altering Amazons and their reptilian pets, the undead techno-abominations of the Assembly, and more.  There was even a species of extragalactic conquerors looking to scavenge the Star Union's remains like a vulture.  It had taken an alliance with the Vanguard and Amazons to finally drive them off the planet.\n\nHe remembered the victory celebration following that victory, held in the very streets his troops were now fighting over.  He\u2019d met the leaders of the Vanguard and Amazons and, before the cheering crowds, swore friendship between their peoples.  \n\nThat was five years ago.  In that time, the Amazons had fallen to the Assembly\u2019s techno-organic horde and he had wiped out the Assembly only to be attacked by the Vanguard.  Now the Vanguard\u2019s armies were broken, and their capital was about to fall.  The Syndicate\u2019s silken banners would fly over the entirety of Arrakis.  It really was a shame that things hadn\u2019t turned out better between them, Sulemar thought as he watched his troops reach the fortified walls of the city\u2019s last stronghold.  He only hoped the Vanguard\u2019s people would accept Syndicate rule peacefully.\n\nAn explosion ripped through several clustered Indentured units and the leader of the 113th Expeditionary Corps, Vanguard General Galen Jerrus, emerged from the smoke in his power armor and ever-present brown trench coat, followed by his remaining heroes and the last Vanguard reserves.  Together they unleashed a storm of bullets and lasers that cut down the closest Syndicate troops and sent the rest scrambling for cover as a fierce firefight began at the stronghold's entrance. \n\nSulemar smiled grimly and raised his trusty psionic sniper rifle.  At last, the treacherous dog had reavealed himself.  His monocle quickly gathered information on his target as he rested the crosshairs on Galen\u2019s head.

The complexity and options in unit composition and tactical choices is staggering. The AI is serviceable, and the lore and aesthetics are far better than the marketing materials led me to believe. It's much more fun than Total War in my opinion and very different from Battletech, the two wargames I've played recently.

If you like Civ (alpha centuri'ish), turn based combat and a decent reward system to upgrade units/Hero's - you will like this!\n\nRaces: Only played as vanguard so far but there are a fair few. Races are all unique (including the minor NPC Factions that you can recruit units/get unique items from if you win their favour).  You can customise your main general which isn't massively in depth, but enough to ensure that your faction doesn't look too much like others.\n\nColony Development:  Its fine - Not the best in this type of game, but not the weakest either.  Build food, research stations etc on that specific colony, invest in better barracks etc...standard stuff.  You can get a few unique buildings when capturing Annexing things like spaceports, armouries etc that can be developed further in order to give you more buffs/resources.\n\nCombat and units: Turn based with cover systems and is pretty fun. You can auto resolve if you wish, but there are many times you will want to manually fight - such as if the odds are not exactly in your favour and you want to minimise loss, or if there is a good chance you will fail. You cannot create giant stacks of doom as each 'Army' can only have 6 units (from what i've seen so far anyway), but can reinforce each other if they are nearby.  Random Hero units will appear outside your main settlement from time to time that you can hire - these can be equipped with different weapons and vehicles/mounts that you can find, be rewarded with or buy in order to help support your troops and win fights. Normal troops can have 3 different items to customise them like flechette rounds or Stim Packs etc, which can be saved under a template of your choice. The longer units are alive, the more experienced and tougher they get - making you feel a little invested in there well being. Heroes can get better also via spending experience on perks/abilities and as mentioned, can be equipped with weapons etc. Want a particular unit to be a bit armoured but supportive - whack them in a tank and give them abilities and tools that can heal troops and provide buffs.  Want another to be a sneaker damage dealer, give them blade, void shift device (warp through cover) and something that makes them harder to hit.  Choices are down to your play style.\n\nMap: Very appealing and remind me a little of Civilisations Alpha Centuri. You can capture/annex unique buildings/tiles that can help boost your faction, grant unique buffs, units or 'Operations'.  be careful as neighbouring factions may have more of a claim to those tiles and capturing them may p*ss them off enough to get enough support for a cassius belli (justify war without much if a penalty). There are roaming aliens, bandits etc defending ruins and many more.  An example is that I captured a sort of old pleasure city that had rogue 'pleasure' bots that were good at mind controlling units and hand to hand combat, which I could then recruit on that tile.\n\nDiplomacy:  Only a little so far due to the Story but there are lots of ways to appease or piss factions off.  Once you are semi friendly, they will reach out from time to time stating that you haven't offered anything/spoke in a while.  The minor NPC factions will give you missions or ask for resources in order to keep them happy and 'progress' to the next stages of your relationship until you sort of merge them with you (in a way).  During each stage unlocks new trade options involving faction specific units and items bought with influence.  Influence is the main currency used when dealing in diplomacy and trade.  NPCs taking up a landmark that you want? Spend some influence to ask them to move without fighting etc.  Want them to help you in a war? Spend 40 influence to get them on side (once you are all Allied that is) - and so on.\n\nOperations: Are various Strategic, tactical or doctrines you can use. They affect the main campaign map or a few can be called in during battle....these cost and cannot be spammed; some taking turns to prepare.\n\nStory: Currently playing through Vanguard Story and there are many 'missions' and ways to complete the missions (and quests within) before moving onto the next campaign - which also transfers your main Commanders progress.  There was a moment where something happened and I feel I could have prevented it.  There are lots of other storys too.\n\nMusic:  Synthwavey at times and orchestral space opera at other.  Battle music is great and fits in well.  Definately does the job on the atmospheric side.  Ambient sounds are great too!\n\nMultiplayer: Haven't tried but only really play these types of games with Friends. I imagine it would be just as fun.\n\nI could write more and may have missed some stuff on these but its still early days with a lot more to be seen and experienced. its a great game and you should get this!  9/10", "timestamp_created": 1591314907, "timestamp_updated": 1591314907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689488887786865234", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "70305226": {"recommendationid": "70305226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017704413", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2699, "last_played": 1596995190}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty good, like many pizza places", "timestamp_created": 1591307997, "timestamp_updated": 1591307997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.4842357337474823", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "70261506": {"recommendationid": "70261506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007400645", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2831, "last_played": 1596328592}, "language": "english", "review": "Deeply well-designed and executed 4x game.

When it released, and I played it for an hour or two, I was extremely disappointed. It was so boring. Pretty; but bland. \n\nSince the latest updates and the Invasion DLC, this game has taken on a complete overhaul.\n\nThere is so much \"fun\" stuff to do now, that it changes how you play 4X games.\nAny, and I mean ANY, plan you had at the end of turn one will change going into turn two.\nThe sector system implementation is awesome. The doctrine system is a game changer.\nBut what I like most of all are the roving marauder armies you come across and the other factions you engage with. \n\nFirst, the marauders. They are roving clans mixed with all these different races making up a 3-6 member squad. And it's so much fun coming across them because of the battles you fight. I can't TELL you how many times I have fought against a unit I don't have access to and said, \"I HAVE GOT TO GET ME ONE OF THESE!\"\n\nAnd even that's saying something. Because right from the beginning, Planetfall gives you quests and POIs to engage with. Usually, these opening battles/quests reward you with out-of-faction units. So from the very beginning, you are fighting with a versatile army and the abilities that come with them. For instance, I love playing as Vanguard. By the time I was four turns in, I had a Spacer AND a Kir'Ko in my very first army. \n\nThe factions are designs of genius. They are NOT located in one portion of the map like a city-state. Instead, they have carved camps out all over the planet. So if you take out an army in some city center of a sector, you haven't rid the planet of that particular faction.  This is where the name in \"Planetfall\" shines. YOU are new to the planet; not them. YOU have to carve out your own existence on this planet; not them. \n\nSo, in the beginning, you engage with them. And once you engage with them, you are given options. You can try diplomacy, you can go to war; the choice is yours. But once you make a decision, you are NOT tied to THAT decision. For instance, the Spacers were the first faction I came across. We worked out a deal where I resolved a quest and got a free unit. But later, they demanded something of me. If I comply, I improve our relations. I thought it was worth it, so I did. \n\nLater, they demanded 100 production resources. I complied again. Later still, they demanded 200 production resources. I complied. Several turns later, they demanded a portion of my Cosmite. I told them to go to ****!\nI ain't given up my Cosmite, man! We didn't go to war, but our relationship deteriorated. Now we're alot like Xi and Trump. \n\nAnyway, the game is much deeper than this. The tech tree is well made and offers you choices that ACTUALLY mean something. The generated maps are so enticing. You can't wait to explore it. And even though the INVASION dlc just hit, and I'm about 40 turns in on a new playthru, I can't wait for the next dlc.

different. i go through a lot of criticism but a lot of it isn't ways in which the game is explicitly bad so to speak. just different. there's still enough to make it feel familiar to long standing fans but it's also changed enough that it's not an automatic buy just because you liked the previous games. \n\nthe magic is still here. it's not like civ: beyond earth. it's still everything you love about AOW (almost). even with the sci-fi setting there's still fantastical dwellings and magic and it's frankly better than in other games. the heroes and dungeons are still all here (if you buy dlc). it's all here but none of it is exactly how you remember it.\n\nthe biggest difference in my opinion is the focus. instead of exploration focus this game has more of a management focus. more of a combat focus too.\n\ni don't like the districts but i appreciate the oppurtunities they gave the developers and i like what they did with it. terraforming etc is a lot more expansive now because of it. but idk. it feels claustrophobic like it's tons of dense smaller areas instead of one bigger world. that kills some of the wonder (no pun intended). don't get me wrong they got a lot of stuff in them and there's stuff to do. but sometimes it kills the sense of scale.\n\nyou can still explore but there's not as much of a reason to. it can still be amazing but it's not the same. i mean there's vechicles to find, weapons, unique technologies and usable skills and they exist at seemingly infinate width. there's so much gear to find and none of it is lame. you can find some really cool shit. but especially if you play with plentiful pickups then the best way to find this stuff is just to mass produce flying scouts and have them auto explore. you don't actually see the world you just click the big FIND STUFF button and then you stop thinking about it. since you're likely too tied down in dense districts to explore anyway. \nin that sense it's better than in past entries because the exploration visibly changes your heroes and armies. but it's kind of missing the wonder (still no pun intended) of past titles. i imagine the dlc will expand on that feeling though. \nyou won't wander out and find the heart of the swamps or whatever. it's simply missing some of the flavor. i get that it's an apocalypic setting but there's no inns or mercenaries or temples or plants or trees. there aren't any worker units, you don't work tiles. and that means the game also has less things to find and pursue. workers have always been tied to exploration in my opinion. you had to hit the streets and find them stuff. you had to venture out to snag outposts and so on. now you can just stay inside your little borders and chill. it's a shame. though as i said districts are dense and they have a lot to do so it's not like it's boring. just different.\n\nbut that's comparing the base game of this one with past games with full expansions. and even so planetfall isn't that far behind, so the future is bright.\n\nthat said the management stuff is better than it's ever been. case and point the customization and builds. you can really really really specify your army. it's great. insane even. something that's made all the better from how beautifully modeled and animated all the units are. what's more the diplomacy is downright good and the dwellings now have writing and personalities and give unique powerful benefits in return for fostering long relationships.\nthe focus on management over exploration makes this a weaker early game but a game that gets better the longer you play. a slow burn, but a good one. combat is the best it's ever been and the campaign map interactability is also the best it's ever been. but it's missing some flavor. in my opinion this was a worthy trade but it needs mentioning so that you don't buy it out of allegience to past titles.\n\nthe tech trees are huge and add a lot of meaningful stuff, but you can't reasonably do all of them in time so you gotta pick a few to focus on and try out combinations. \n\nDLC is pretty essential. they add a lot of that flavor i've been talking about. i think this game might even surpass AOW3 once all the expansions are out. so far it's looking great. even if the last DLC doesn't focus on exploration or \"wonder\" i have full faith that it's going to be another amazing edition to the game.",

actual mechanics. While they look like they could be interesting in fact they often become a detriment.\n\nStarting with cities and sectors. Where before your city grew in area of influence now you build a city on a sector and as it grows it allows you to annex up to 5 sectors that are adjacent to one that is part of the city. Looks interesting until you realise that you need to keep units around for the sole purpose of going around annexing as needed and then you have to build upgrades on annexed sectors on top of that also concurring with any other city building you need to do. Where the latter could be called a strategical decision, the former 2 are completly pointless and boring micromanagement. They serve no other purpose than busywork.\n\nFollowing on cities and pointless busywork, cities need food to grow, to grow a city at a fast enough pace you'll need food dedicated sectors, but once you reach the cap of max sectors, extra growth speed is pointless even if more people is still nice to get extra bonus. This means that early on you want at least one food sector but then you have to demolish it later to trade for something better. Meaning, more pointless busywork.\n\nBefore it was hard to actually control your domain in AoW because doing perfect math to make sure your area of influence had absolutly no gaps so the enemy wasn't constantly trying to build a city in those gaps was a headache, now you have double the headache trying to plan where you need to put cities and count which exact pieces of land they take so that the enemy can't take it, so in this point we only changed how you get the headache instead of addressing the fact that you are gettign one. But now you have the added problem that enemies build in your claimed sectors and thus create a permanent relation debuff which only penalises the player for something the AI did it himself.\n\nAs for combat it's one step forward and two steps back. We now can give units permanent enchantments in the form of mods, that is good albeit the customisation level is stageringly bad. But now we are back on the hit chances that AoW2 had. While I can understand the idea that it leads to more tactical options, fact of the matter is that it just becomes more RNG.\n\nSince I talked about the low customisation. This is a problem that came from AoW3. I've complained as did many that the game has a very low level os customisation. in AoW3 you picked a class which gave you 90% of your research tree and then you picked a little extra that left a bad taste in your mouth. In planetfall the problem maintains. You get your race and all of it's tech + social tech which is 90% of the tech tree and then you have the other 10% being the super tech you pick which not only is severely lacking is customisation, it often is just not even good anyway.\n\nLastly, not necessarely a problem of the developers but this certainly needs addressing. There isn't a proper wiki. If a player wants to try to try and play with a certain build, like say, going with a really high damaging army or go with an army that heavly favors debuffing enemies or maybe one that has really good dodging chances. There is no place where we can look all technology and all mods and all units easily so that we can decide on where to go and how to do it.\n\nAfter playing this game for a little bit more there are a couple things that need to be added to this review.\n\nThe first being balance. Sadly it doesn't exists! There is on race that stands above all the other by a really big margin and all the other races are either varying degrees bad or ok at best. The problem with most races is that they lack a really good early game unit that can take you through the game until you reach your end game unit that is going to be your bread and butter. One race archieves this, all the other races either don't have an early game unit that is capable at all or don't have a good enough end game unit.\n\nThe second problem is actually the biggest problem I find with this game and it is a problem that just makes people not want to play the game at all... Now the campaign is alright and all, but honestly, no one plays it for the campaign, what is the primary point of the game is just making a custom game and go beat some AI in a scenario that doesn't has dumb rules enforced... Up to here everything looks fine.\n\nExcept it isn't. For starters, we don't have an islands type map to control to some degree spacing between yourself and enemies which means often you have to just keep reloading the game after several turns when you discover that an enemy spawned very near you and the landgrab is gonna be a headache. Then there is the issue that you need your starting location to be good. For example, I need my starting location to always have 2 food sectors at least and be next to water so that I can make the first city into a food producing colony that will then be able boost the other colonies growth. This on top of not having an AI on top of me.\n\nEsencially this means that players restart over and over and over again and it takes hours before you actually roll a stable enough game start. Something you didn't had a problem at all in AoW3. I rarely had to re-roll a starting location!", "timestamp_created": 1590599755, "timestamp_updated": 1603732670, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50361102819442749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "69897439": {"recommendationid": "69897439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142776061", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1122, "last_played": 1611994929}, "language": "english", "review": "I Love Xcom...

This game is a hybrid of Civ 4, Endless Legend and Might and Magic. I can say it's better combat wise than Might and Magic, but is too shallow compared to Civ and Endless. The game overall is very slow paced. All the races are visually different but play exactly the same. The game needs more mystery, more surprises or random events to keep it interesting. I think the map may be too big for the default races and there are too many \"barbarians\" of varying difficulties on the map, along with neutral races which are far too powerful. Everything feels inconsequential. Thankfully auto-battle is pretty good, however, actually playing out the battles isn't very fun. It feels like the tactical battles are where the focus is, so that's disappointing. The main issue is the AI is maybe too smart on normal. If they have a numbers advantage and you hang back, they won't approach, even wild animals. They will flank and surround you. I never felt like my units had enough range and the melee units and heroes are tough to keep alive. I had to save scum a lot, which is unusual for me, being a veteran of  many turned based strategy games as well. I had better success with auto battle which is never good. The tutorial teaches you the very basics, but not what you need to know to beat a \"risky\" encounter. I feel that the \"spells\" you can cast as the commander (like in Heroes of Might and Magic) must be required to have great success. Even \"low risk\" fights can kill you if you're playing them manually, ironically, so even thought the game doesn't explicitly say it, you need to use the \"battle spells\". The problem is battle spells cost energy, which is used for producing units, issuing edicts, tribute, ect, unlike Might and Magic, where they are a separate resource. I would like the \"battle spells\" to cost a different resource, so you could go into battle without worrying if you have the energy to win; it's jarring to get used to. I think a cool down-based system like Might and Magic would work better. I'm not sure why they nixed it, other than to make Energy even more precious. You could spend hundreds of hours with the game, but there are more complete games out there right now. I would recommend Civilization or Stellaris if you're looking for a 4x strategy game, or Endless Space/Legend for a 4x/Might and Magic hybrid that does it better.

The unique units, mods, and mechanics make for a great tactical combat system with a ton of depth.\n\nThere are so many interesting decisions to make that all lead to vastly different results and playstyles but all feel valid and extremely effective if done well! All the decisions and the tons of options for different worlds to be randomly generated also give it great replayability!\n\nInvasions adds awesome additional mechanics where the game was most lacking, which tbh in my mind was mainly a diversity of races and random world events.

It's like Civ isn't it? Well, actually no, but it is like another Firaxis title which you've likely heard of: XCOM. This is a tactical combat wargame, like XCOM but on steroids. But it also has a strategic game as well which is more like Total War rather than Civ. We'll come back to that later.\n\nFirst though, the Tactical Combat is undeniably the main event of the game. This is where you'll spend most of your time.\n\nYou can mod (customise) your units with equipment unlocked by tech or bought from a neutral faction.\n\nYour units are squads rather than individual units for the most part. Some higher tier units are individual units.\n\nYou have customisable leaders which earn experience which gives them new skills. You choose which skills and the equipment to fit them out. They can fight on foot, from a vehicle or beast or even from an aircraft.\n\nYou have Operations which you can call in during a fight with a wide variety of effects, from healing to laser strikes, call in special units or cause panic to enemy units or even subvert them etc.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the auto combat is actually pretty fair in this game so if you don't want to fight every piddly little action, you can reliably trust the auto combat to do the job. And if you don't like the result you get, you have the option to refight it yourself. How fair is that?\n\nThen there's the strategic map where you build your colonies and develop them. This is more like a Total War campaign map rather than Civ. The colony building is nowhere near as deep as it is in Civ but it's on  a par with TW Warhammer, at least. There are neutral factions on the map which you can do quests for or exterminate depending on your play style. There are 'barbarian' spawn sites as well as 'treasure' to find, both guarded and free to gather.\n\nOverall, it's a very satisfying experience if you like tactical battles. The AI is above average and can use all the abilities and skills their units possess.

The game has a Total War / Civilization like campaign map, and when units clash on the campaign map you start a battle that plays something like a board game version of an XCOM game.\n\nNeither component is \"bad\", but neither has really been able to draw me in either. The campaign map is just mindnumbingly easy to the point that I've never had to worry about any resource whatsoever. The battles are sorta clunky, with units moving at slow speeds (and you can't tab to another unit and move it until the first unit stops.. unlike many games of this type).\n\nAt the end of the day I'd just rather be playing a game that does one of these things quite well, instead of a game that does both only passably. Either that, or I'll just fire up a Total War game.. which ultimately does both components far better, although it does have a real time battle system instead of a turn based one.

(Can't recommend that game enough as well!) I played so much of it, and then discovered that Planetfall was a thing. Cannot tell you how excited I was to see that!\n\nThough I've only recently gotten the chance to check out Planetfall, but it hasn't disappointed at all! It has everything I could hope for in a sci-fi AOW.\n\nHighlights:\n-I'm finding combat to be significantly more brutal, as there are so many units using firearms/ranged weapons, actually flying units (I know AOW3 had them but they would just land after moving/to attack) which definitely changes the battlefield to be a much more deadly place. \n-Each race offers a significantly different style of play, and the classes/tech specializations make for some interesting and powerful synergies. \n-Though you won't be able to defend any walled fortresses like you did in AOW3, I personally find this to be much more realistic in an advanced world, as modern warfare itself rarely has battles and fortress-like structures like there were in medieval times. I know there are people who wish there were walls in this game, but I'm finding that their absence makes defending your base far more exciting!\n-You can choose your leader's starting gear!!! In AOW3, I tended to favor the Dreadnaught class, as my commander had a mace and a musket. I quite often found I didn't like many of the other classes' starting weapon. In Planetfall, you are able to choose your commanders' initial weapons, regardless of race/class. \n-Lore. I have not delved into the campaigns at all yet, but just from reading about the different races and reading the different codex entries, there is a lot to be discovered!\n\nLow points:\n-If there is one bad thing I can say about this game, it is that I find the commander's appearances (specifically some of the faces) to be rather hard on the eyes. There are certainly ways to mitigate it to a point where it's a non-issue, but just be warned. :)", "timestamp_created": 1587966596, "timestamp_updated": 1587966863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "68085100": {"recommendationid": "68085100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022151499", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1971, "last_played": 1592178557}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game", "timestamp_created": 1587939735, "timestamp_updated": 1587939735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "68075338": {"recommendationid": "68075338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053662088", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1590817983}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing 4X game.", "timestamp_created": 1587926977, "timestamp_updated": 1587926977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "68072086": {"recommendationid": "68072086", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969972450", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2747, "last_played": 1573424746}, "language": "english", "review": "Just not as good as the previous two.

The mini-map is terrible.  its very difficult to see the cities and the heroes are not shown at all. So its very difficult to figure out where your heroes are.

Another feature i really dislike is that there are no borders on right or left. if you character goes out the right side it pops out on the left side.  This makes it even more difficult to figure out where you character is, being that you cant see them on the mini map.  In addition to that, the terrain all looks so similar.  Everything just looks the same.   \n    Also, you get missions from cities which send your characters to go do something (like destroy an army).  Another huge problem is the army you have to destroy can pop up anywhere you have territory and the characters move SO SLOWLY.  if you do the missions you wont be able to do do anything else because it takes 2 weeks of to get there and then next mission pops up.   I could go on and on. the research tree is a mess.  only maybe 10% of the stuff is worth researching, but there is no way to just turn on auto research so it just moves to something else when it finishes. instead it constantly asks you what want to research next with no end in sight until you have researched everything.  you cant even select the ability further into the research tree that you want and have it auto-research the prerequisites to get to it.

Naturally, it makes sense to compare the two.\n\nGood changes:\n+ Economics were dramatically overhauled and now there are 5 resources instead of just gold and mana. A lot of ideas were borrowed and improved on from Endless Legends and it shows\n+ Dividing the map into sectors that can be captured and improved was an awesome development for the series and it's very satisfying watching the sectors change color as you capture them like a game of risk\n+ Diplomacy and NPC factions were buffed significantly and far more interesting\n+ The new sci-fi races are much more interesting than the usual fantasy races of orcs, goblins, elves, etc; they feel well thought out although I don't feel they are very balanced\n\nBad changes:\n- Unfortunately, I feel that tactical combat has been changed for the worse in most ways, which sucks because that is one of the main draws of the series. The biggest change is that almost every unit has ranged attacks and every unit seems \"squisher\", so units die much quicker. You can have a Tier V unit on the field and it will go down to focused fire from 3-4 Tier I-II units in two rounds. Late-game units felt so much more powerful and meaningful in AOW3. Units no longer have automatic zone of control, which means that melee enemies can run past all of your blockers and attack more vulnerable units\n- Related to the point above, no more castle sieges. Perhaps its more fitting with the sci-fi theme but city defense and attack combat is much less interesting than AOW3 when a smart player could hold off 5-6 stacks of enemies with 2 stacks of defenders\n\nOverall, the game is good and worth a purchase.

The combat is brilliant and tactical, empire building and diplomacy has enough to keep you occupied with out tedious micromanagement... the same goes for scouting, the scouts actually work on their own pretty well with very little need to oversee every detail.

Arguably, AoW 3 has a similar problem, in the regard, and it remains one of my least-played TBS games within my steam library.  I have been a huge fan of Age of Wonders ever since the first, but each sequel within this franchise seems to get progressively worse, and Age of Wonders: Planetfall is an Age of wonders game in name only.  \n\nFor me, I think I'm going to call it quits on this franchise entirely.   \n\nAoW was amazing.  12 playable races with unique units for each, as well as leader magic specializations and an in-depth leader customization  that is still unparalled in any of the sequels.\n\nAoW 2 was lackluster.  Less races, poorer leader customization imo.\n\nAoW: Shadow Magic was slightly better.  Added two new races, which made up for some of the shortfalls of AoW 2.\n\nAoW 3 was very uninspiring.  Only 4 or 5 playable races, and the leader customization pigeon-holes you into a leader archetype that in the end makes you feel like your leader  wasn't really custom after all.\n\nAoW: Planetfall is the low point of this franchise.  No more magic, instead opting to use a similar mechanic with a different name.  Game is set in a sci-fi universe, which doesn't match up with ANYTHING Age of Wonders before now, and I'm not a fan.  I knew it was sci-fi from the beginning when I got the game, but figured I'd give it a chance.  Still only 4 playable races, which in and of itself is enough for me to request a refund, but leader customization went event further into the pigeon-holed approach that makes your leader feel less custom, and more just like you picked how you wanted your leader to look.\n\nTriumph, if you're listening, I want an Age of Wonders game that captures the feel of the original!  (Or just remaster the original, idk.  It doesn't work on any  Windows 10 machine I've tried it on, sadly).\n\nMy response in discord when a friend asked why I decided to refund AoW: Planetfall:\n\nI just figure that if i quit a game intentionally before i've put 2 hours into it, and then excitedly look at my time played stat on Steam and go 'good, i can still refund it' it means I should probably refund it.\n\nIt just....wasn't AoW.   The tactical combat was still solid, and they added some nice features, like combat cover mechanics.    But there wasn't any magic in an Age of Wonders game.  There was also only, like, 4 races, which is really, really lacking (AoW 3 had a similar problem, I think, and that was my biggest gripe about that one, too).\n\nhonestly if they remastered the original AoW and revamped its multiplayer bits to actually allow multiplayer again, it would be so popular, imo.", "timestamp_created": 1585950430, "timestamp_updated": 1585950430, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512997150421142578", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "66528668": {"recommendationid": "66528668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068379191", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 6013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6013, "last_played": 1568490959}, "language": "english", "review": "5/10 In short, it is not a disaster but for me in all aspects of the game is just MEH, that is the summary: Meh..\n\n(For a \"civ-like\", \"civ meets X-com\" game there is no options, no nitty-gritty, it's too simple for my taste. -1 coz it's too simple for amount of money u pay. -1 for amount of available units(the amount is bear minimum and it shows in combat, the synergys are small amount), -1 for small amount of tech & small branching tree's, -1 for no city management, again it's too straight forward, too simple. -1 for no free demo coz every civ lover will fall for this trap expecting to be similar when it's not and 2 hours is not enough for a 4x game.)", "timestamp_created": 1585944758, "timestamp_updated": 1592652005, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442822396755218506", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "66496492": {"recommendationid": "66496492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035732100", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1585909818}, "language": "english", "review": "Did you like all the other A.O.W games and their expansions?

Does not veer too far from AoW3 while still different enough to not feel like a DLC masquerading as a brand new game. Diplomacy is usually lackluster in 4X games. But in Planetfall, the diplomacy works well though it is simply implemented. Not much to trade, but the Casus Belli system works well. You can manipulate it effectively so you can go to war with a faction without incurring any negative effects from your population and other factions. Factions are varied and somewhat balanced, though units aren't as diverse and interesting as in AoW3. I love the winning conditions, especially the cooldown period of 10 turns, after you met all victory requirements, where you must defend your position and keep your victory assets while often the AI gangs up on you. NPCs keep you busy in the early game and helps you units gather experience.\n\nThere are a few things I don't like about Planetfall. The Score victory condition does not work well and should be deactivated before starting a game. Not clear how they calculate the total score but sometimes you should be in the lead on score and yet you are near the bottom. You lead in every category except Total Score... Odd. The sound bites that blare when a trade is accepted or rejected is very annoying. And you can't see most of the other factions in the rankings because you have not infiltrated the factions through spying. A bit ridiculous to have squashed a faction and yet not be able to see its ranking and other stats in listings, that faction being listed as Unknown. You defeat a faction in battle and yet it is listed as Unknown... Again, odd. Spying presents a lot of different mechanisms, but none of them are really worth the expense or effort, except in a few very special cases. The spying missions fail a lot (bad RNG) and overall feels like a waste. The new anomalies in the DLC are interesting in the early part of the game, but later in the game, I just don't bother with them because the items awarded are not worth the effort, especially since it forces a hero to sit there idle on the map.\n\nOverall, I am enjoying Planetfall.

By chance I saw that Planetfall was on sale (-50%). I never looked back and became instantly addicted. This game truly deserves all its positive reviews. Even the negative reviews do not report game breaking technical issues or bugs. Some reviewers just  preferred a previous game from the same developers (Age of wonders 1-3) Some have criticized the visual appearance of the game. (Looks fine to me, very nice artwork on the unit cards, research tree and encyclopaedia are a bit minimalist, decent tactical combat graphics) Some people just gave up on the game after less than 10 hours.\n\nI can confidently recommend this game for people who like 4X games (Xpand Xplore Xploit Xterminate) such as Alpha centauri, Civilisation, Warlock, Master of Magic, Endless legend, Stellaris and others. It is a fine mix of strategic map management and tactical combat. Tactical combat has similarities to X-Com but without the brutal rng failures and timer (you do have dice rolls and skill checks but you also have a drop down box detailing combat events for all the hardcore game nerds) . Once you start understanding the wonderful complexities of different possible builds and strategies it begins to feel like an advanced form of chess where you want to plan your colony expansions several turns in advance and grab special structures that will give you special bonuses. \n\nUnits can be enhanced with mods in so many different ways. Armies consist of 6 units (including a hero who can also be customized with melee or ranged weapons, offensive or defensive mods, perks to enhance the hero or the army) Your starting faction and planet can be customized (in so many ways it will make your head spin) or randomized. \n\nThere is an amazing level of complexity that will appeal to most strategy players who like to figure out the best possible builds for their factions.\n\nThe game rewards exploration. There is true joy in discovering rare items after defeating powerful enemies in dangerous locations.\n\nThe game will appeal to players who like to expand all over the map without expansion penalties. (You still have to manage your economy and be prepared for invasions) There are many paths to victory. Diplomacy may look deceptively simple but it is actually quite a juggling act among all the major factions.  And it seems to work for me so far. You must also handle minor factions that can sell you techs and units to improve your armies and offer quests, bounties, rewards or make demands. \n\nAND there is a cool Science fiction story (about the fall of a galactic empire and the struggles of various factions in the ensuing turmoil)   that plays out during the campaign. I enjoy discovering the backstory for some heroes and factions. With branching story lines you may even want to play the campaign more than once if you don't spoil it by researching it on the web.\n\nBEGINNER TIPS: Do the tutorial (first campaign mission) The game will suggest you  play the practise planet before you do the second campaign mission. Do this. Choose hero Helen Shaw for the practise planet. (You will learn more about Helen during the next campaign mission.) You will feel lost at this point. (\"What do I do next?\") Find the you tube video \"Planetfall 10 beginner tips\" by Frost Ees OP\nHave fun. Experiment. Discover. \n\nI can easily see myself playing over 1000 hours  of this game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1584457574, "timestamp_updated": 1584457574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.839095771312713623", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "65186729": {"recommendationid": "65186729", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984465565", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 19975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7918, "last_played": 1610637929}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Civ or other 4x games check this out.

Many 4X games have unit upgrade systems but there's always unfun restrictions put in place for \"realism\", like you have to retrofit your units at a base or something.  This game lets you mod them wherever they are and gives you a button to mod all the units on the field, and it's done in one turn.  Not realistic but very fun!  It encourages you to grow attached to your units and experiment with their role instead of just throwing them out as you tech.  The different combinations of mods coming from all these sources really help differentiate your units from another player's and keeps the experience fresh.\n\nTo top it all off it's got a great tactical combat system that is made all the greater by all the options available to you.\n\nThis has to be my favourite strategy game.", "timestamp_created": 1583207307, "timestamp_updated": 1583207307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "64421995": {"recommendationid": "64421995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088428401", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4183, "last_played": 1610312847}, "language": "english", "review": "If you loved the Age of Wonders series but wonder what it would be like in the future than look no further than Planetfall especially since the recent Tyrannosaurus Update has fixed and added to the complexity and individuality of each race while still remaining seamlessly organic and simple for a strategy game:)", "timestamp_created": 1583178060, "timestamp_updated": 1583178060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "64421082": {"recommendationid": "64421082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011915389", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1810, "last_played": 1600621546}, "language": "english", "review": "BLUF: If you like 4X games with a Sci-Fi theme and/or unit customization you'll probably like this game.

I was a big fan of AoW III although I had only played the original AoW and AoW II a few times.  I think they did a great job taking the basic game play concepts from AoW III and converting them into this new Sci-Fi theme.  The graphics are good, the maps quite varied and look hand painted.  I really enjoy the idea of unlocking new MODs to upgrade your troops with to customize your formations/armies.  I also think it's great that they give viable options for keeping your hero on foot or mounted in a vehicle.  Multiplayer is good, especially with the fact that the game is saved automatically to some kind of server and folks just got into multiplayer and select play to resume.  I also really like the Doctrines and Strategic/Tactical Operations concept, really provides a lot of options for tailoring play style.\n\nCons:  A buddy and I did experience a desynch bug in our first multiplayer game that basically corrupted the save so it would crash to desktop every time you reloaded it.  There is no option to create your own save in multiplayer I don't believe.

Also feels like there's too many win conditions (unifier, doomsday, domain, score, etc.) that just pile onto the list that you need to monitor. Combat is great, but due to mods you really have to pay attention to each individual unit to have a good ideal of its capabilities. I've gotten several friends to play this game and they all just give up on trying to get into the depth of the game because its so overwhelming. Also doesn't help that there's like 8 different currencies to keep track of.\n\nAnd Valkyrie should be a producable, modable unit.

There's a colonization and expansion part that involves exploring a newly settled planet and establishing colonies then expanding them up by annexing and specializing adjacent sectors.   Each sector has the potential to provide bonuses to FOOD for population growth, ENERGY for unit and operational costs (tactical and strategic), PRODUCTION for colony and unit generation, and KNOWLEDGE for military and social research.   Annexed sectors can be improved through additional building construction and research policies.  Some sectors contain unique landmarks that provide a specific resource boost and may also contain features such as rivers or lava streams that can be tapped though research to provide a boost to food or energy as well.  Each colony can only annex a maximum of 4 sectors so you have to have an idea of what you want a colony to specialize in and annex sectors that will fulfill that specialization (FOOD, ENERGY, PRODUCTION, or KNOWLEDGE).   You can build and acquire additional colonizer units to expand your empire and the only real downside to playing wide vs tall is protecting your colonies from other players.  There are colony upgrades that provide militia units and defense towers that will fend off most aggressive NPC attacks.\n\nThe strategic (world) map contains random resource stash pickups, anomalies that can provide encounters resulting in unique units and gear, NPC faction settlements you can befriend, trade and ally with, or even attack and conquer.  Allied NPCs will often provide quests (missions) and make demands on you for assistance or resources.   Once your reputation is high enough you can buy their units, offensive and defensive mods, or even ask them to go to war with you.  \n\nIn your travels across the planet you'll also run across other players (human or AI) and can also ally and trade with them, perform covert operations on their colonies, or go to war with them.  The diplomatic dialog is similar to Civilization where you can negotiate to trade resources, set up defensive pacts, send gifts or make demands.  You can also make pronouncements that can increase or decrease your standing with them.  The declare war system is similar to Civilization as you'll take a reputation hit for attacking other players without just cause.  If they settle near your colony, or insult you, or if you use covert operations to fabricate false accusations about them, they will build up Casus Belli, which allows you to declare war without taking a negative penalty hit to your reputation.  Reputation is global.  What you do will have affect on how other player and non player NPC factions treat you.\n\nYou start out with one hero unit which is your faction commander, who can be improved over time as they gain experience.  You can also recruit additional hero units and there many abilities they can select from like increasing their health, or improving ranged/melee attack and defense or providing auras (buffs) to the units under their direct command.  Units are typically grouped in armies of 6 but can also travel the world map as individuals or in smaller groups to perform scouting or to pick up resources in random guarded/unguarded stashes.\n\nYou can built different combat units specific to the race your chose to play and each race has unique traits and damage types, called damage channels.  They include kinetic, thermal, biological, electrical,   and even psionic.  There are several different races to chose from such as Vanguard Starship Trooper type units, animal riding Amazon warriors in tune with creatures and forests, human/machine cyborg units called The Assembly, Kir'ko insectoids, a shady trade style guild called The Syndicate that utilizes rogue/assassin style mechanics, and some Dwarven type Dvar that specialize in planetary mining and terraforming.  I can't go into detail on each as there is so much information so do a search to read some in- depth guides or watch some videos.  There are also separate branches of secret research that every race can select that will provide additional specialized units and operations.  They include Promethean that deals in fire, Celestian that draws from a spiritual plane, Xenoplague that is all about biological weapons and plague, Psynumba which deals with psionics, Synthesis which revolves around machines, and Voidtech that bends space and time.  The combination of different races and secret technology allows for even more varied builds.  You can also pick up units from different NPC factions as you complete missions, or clear resource stashes.\n\nCombat is played out on tactical maps that utilize cover, line of sight (LoS) and range.  Each side in the battle consisting of players, NPCs, or random marauders, can bring stacks of units in different armies, that will each take turns moving or using abilities.  There are ground and flying units that specialize in various ranged (rifles, pistols, grenades, rockets), close combat melee, and AoE attacks and you use including researched tactical operations to assist you in the fight.  Units can take cover, repair or heal each other, summon additional units, and even resurrect fallen allies.  There are a lot of different weapons, unit mods, and abilities that can vary depending on the race and secret research chosen at the start of the game or trading with NPC factions and discovered on the strategic map.  There are coastal and ocean sectors with available naval units but these areas doesn't seem to offer as much in the way of resources and may see some changes in additional DLC or patches.\n\nAs with other 4X games, there are different ways to win a game, from diplomacy, exploration, or absolute domination.   The game includes several campaigns you can play through and a random map generator to play skirmish style with AI or human players.   Advanced map generation allows you to adjust a huge variety of options to suit your play style.", "timestamp_created": 1582862756, "timestamp_updated": 1582936606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471698105335235596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "64223570": {"recommendationid": "64223570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031295695", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 771, "last_played": 1585243926}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the series.

The developers added an incredible amount of depth and creativity to the game.  Unfortunately more depth normally means a game that is much harder to play.  To minimize this the developers put considerable effort into making the actual gameplay easy and enjoyable.  For instance in the tactical battles there are many choices available when one unit is attacking one or multiple other units.  The game uses color and numerical indicators to show the range, potential damage and odds of a hit.  In addition, instead just a \"hit\" or \"miss\", a lesser \"graze\" damage is employed as well.  So even when going against a well entrenched, high defense unit send enough hurt its way and even with lower odds that unit will eventually meet its demise.  \n\nIt is true, when I first started playing the game it was a challenge to learn the tremendous depth and complexity the game offers but I actually enjoyed discovering the numerous different ways and choices that are available at all phases of the game.  These strategic and tactical choices are one of the key things that keeps me playing.  Like AofW III there is a great modding community with support from the developers to keep the game fresh.  The game has a customizable random map generator with up to 12 players in addition to multiple NPC factions with their own peculiarities.  Each of the available races have a different feel and though the races to me are pretty well balanced the play strategies vary in order to take advantage of the race differences.  The heroes can equip items and gain selectable abilities.  In addition in Planetfall each regular unit can receive items that are available if you have the right resources.  There are also interesting side quests that require a hero.\n\nThe above are just a few of the reasons why AofW Planetfall is now my all time favorite game.

I've logged thousands of hours in that title, and keep coming back for more... especially after Plantfall. \n\nI can't quite put my finger on it, but Planetfall just doesn't seem to quite reach that bar of addiction that I had anticipated.  The setting is solid, the art is pleasing, the soundtrack works well, but there's something about the mechanics that seems clunky and forced.  The city system and unit upgrades are too reminiscent of Endless Space, and the tech tree is very Civ.  It's almost as if the developers tried to mash together all of the other  successful 4X titles to cultivate a winner, but as such it feels fragmented.\n\nOne of my biggest meh moments is that I don't feel invested in the heroes or armies.  In AoW3, for me at least, the armies took on a character all their own.  I would anguish over the loss of a well performing unit and begrudge his replacement as an untried rookie.  I'm just not getting that same endearing quality from Planetfall, at least not yet.\n\nDon't get me wrong...all in all, Planetfall is actually a pretty good game.  It just didn't live up to my hopes for an AoW sucessor.  I'll certainly keep playing it, and don't regret preordering the premium edition either.  I just question whether it will ever replace it's predecessor as my 4x of choice.\n\nEDIT 4/22:\n\nOk, it grows on you.  I can definitely say that I am pleased with the game overall and that it scratches the AoW itch pretty well.  The Revelations add-on was definitely well done and introduced my favorite class to date in the Heritors (I was really fond of the Theocrat in AoW3).

My favorite is Heroes of Might & Magic (HOMM). I've played all the way through AOW3 and the DLC's. King's Bounty: Yes. XCOM: Yes. Original Fallout: Yes. Order of Battle: Yes. Mordheim: Yes. Battletech: Yes. Etc.\n\nUsually I don't play Civ type 4X games. They feel too micro managie for me. The thing I like most a bout HOMM is exploring and building up my city and armies. I know when my troops are strong enough to defeat someone. I usually just do auto resolve for battles. I like playing as an explorer & a general. Give me the overview of what's going on. If I know my troops are strong enough to win that's good for me. I don't care about the turn based battle itself.\n\n[b]Game Review:[/b]\n(note: My Steam hours for Planetfall are low, but I've played through and won the single player campaign. I'm not online that much.)\n\nOK now that you know my gaming perspective on to Planetfall. Really FOR ME its the closest to a modern HOMM replacement that I can find. I get to explore build up my colonies, tech trees and armies. Once you learn the best way to manage your resources (energy, cosmonite diplomacy, food) you can focus on exploring and winning battles or settling things diplomatically. Yes there are SPECIFIC ways to manage your resources so you don't usually have to worry about them.\n\nYou can DEFINITELY settle many thing diplomatically. Yes, sometimes the AI will punk you in certain scenarios and you HAVE to go to war, but many times you can finess you way out of it or delay it for many many turns.\n\nALWAYS try to keep the NPC's happy with you. Being able to buy troops diretly from them is a HUGE advantage. Even if different factions don't like you working for the other you can generally keep them all happy.\n\nThe developers have released a lot of patches improving the gameplay and balance a lot. I commend them for this.\n\n[b]Improvements:[/b]\nToo many notifications. They just seem spamy @ times though I think they've improved in newer iterations, but stil.\n\nI'd personally like to be able to play a COMPLETELY diplomatic campnpagin. I guess I'll probably have to make my own mod for it.\n\nI'd like to be able to choose the colony that troops I buy from NPC factions go to, instead of just my main one.\n\nI'd like to be able to set my own teleportation sites instead of them being randomly generated or already placed on certain maps.\n\nHard to do online play if you don't already know someone. It seems like most of the onle games are coordinated between people who know each other. It'd be nice if there was a chat in the online room so people could randomly get together.\n\n[b]Summary:[/b]\nOverall I really LOVE the game. Right now I'm finishing the Revelations campaign.

The game in the \"Tactical Combat mode\" is a shallower X-com experience. Even though AoW: Planetfall isn't a unique game mechanics wise, it takes the most fun aspects from two very popular games and merges them amazingly. The game is a great alternative for either X-com or Civ players. Graphics wise the game has some aspects that leave some animations a little lack luster, however overall the game has some pretty biomes, detailed strategic worlds and decent character design. After a few days of playing I noticed a slightly game breaking bug where the death animation of a flying Scrapper unit would cause the combat screen to freeze on the turn icon. The bug can always be skipped by using auto combat on the battle screen however this takes away the manual combat against an NPC faction which is a shame. AI wise it is decent (although I haven't been playing for long) and I haven't come across any extremely stupid AI decisions. Overall the game is a solid 7/10 and would probably be a 9 or 8 if I hadn't come across this game breaking bug.", "timestamp_created": 1582382406, "timestamp_updated": 1582382690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520123839378356934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "63933576": {"recommendationid": "63933576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027370117", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2897, "last_played": 1583751793}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun", "timestamp_created": 1582379129, "timestamp_updated": 1582379129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "63932342": {"recommendationid": "63932342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087143966", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 248, "last_played": 1588686355}, "language": "english", "review": "gud", "timestamp_created": 1582377658, "timestamp_updated": 1582377658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "63917800": {"recommendationid": "63917800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051636732", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6817, "last_played": 1607238668}, "language": "english", "review": "Dense and lots of replayability", "timestamp_created": 1582358761, "timestamp_updated": 1582358761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "63909026": {"recommendationid": "63909026", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970825711", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 3681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3451, "last_played": 1582400388}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent sci-fi addition to the Age of Wonders series that just keeps getting better and better.

The main thing I miss is more interesting level up bonuses & evolving units, but other than that specific thing, I think AoW:P is better than AOW3.\n\nIf you haven't played AoW 3, or Endless Legend for that matter, then I'm not sure how to describe the game to you. It's a strategy conquest game where you found cities, send armies out, conquer things, etc. etc. Where AoW does its best work is in how enjoyable the combat is, and in the joy of exploring the map with your armies, clearing dungeons, picking up bonuses, etc. If you enjoy turn based strategic combaton a hex grid, then you'll probably dig AoW, because I think it's honestly the strongest entry in the genre for that specific niche.", "timestamp_created": 1582251317, "timestamp_updated": 1604935077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54021376371383667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "63849796": {"recommendationid": "63849796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046211488", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 298, "last_played": 1582180366}, "language": "english", "review": "Not terrible, not great.  \n\nI'm not upset at having bought it, but if I could go back in time, I wouldn't have done so.\n\nI picked this up on sale for the $45 Premium Edition, and wound up spending just over two hours making it through setup, tutorial, and through the first mission or two of a campaign.  I kinda wanted to refund, but had crossed steams threshold, so I carried on a bit to see if it would grow on me.\n\nWhat I wanted in a game was a new and interesting spiritual successor to Xcom.  This game offers a micro-game of tactical combat in that fashion, but it's a far cry from the immersion and intricacy of the Xcom series.  This game also offers a macro-game similar to a Civilization Hex-map 4x game...but with an order of magnitude more complexity in resources, settlement/city-building, and encounters.\n\nI personally found this to be the worst of both worlds regarding Tactical Turn-based strategy and 4x.   The tactics were pretty blunt and un-synergistic in combat (I found myself thinking after a half dozen battles \"I don't see how my control is any better or even any different than what auto-play would be doing\"), while the 4x was overburdened by some dozen resources to manage and deep-but-narrow options at the strategic level (I found myself thinking of the skill tree \"Okay, i have two options, and they're not mutually exclusive...so I guess I just click the next one in line\").\n\nRegarding backstory, I'm not usually one to care about dialogue and campaign, preferring to just get to the action and execution of things, but the story behind this seemed particularly cheesy B-sci-fi movie that they let the intern write up, and did not help my engagement with the game at all.\n\nThings got worse as I progressed through campaign, having several heroes leading armies that I didn't really have time to put my heart into learning about, as it's been 5 hours and I kinda just want to not be playing this anymore.  Admittedly, I could just be a cruddy strategic commander, so mileage may vary.\n\n\nAll that being said, I *can* tell that a lot of effort and heart went into creating this game,and I don't think it's anything like a terrible game in and of itself.  It's got good visuals and a seemingly sound engine underneath the hood.\n\nI would sincerely believe someone that does love and enjoy playing this game.  It just definitely does not scratch any of the itches I had, and I'd ultimately rather just boot up either Civ or Xcom that do each of these things better.", "timestamp_created": 1582243748, "timestamp_updated": 1582244225, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472882062196731567", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "63849349": {"recommendationid": "63849349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075039896", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 13702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 6669, "last_played": 1618965360}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty fun.

I would go so far as to say that I do not recommend this game to anyone who hadn't played AoW3, or to anyone who'd played it and didn't like it.\n\n[strike]For those of you who have played and liked AoW3, I [i]would[/i] recommend AoW:P. It's similar enough that you should be able to get comfortable with it fairly quickly, yet different enough to give you a new experience.[/strike]\n\nFor more details, let me give you a quick rundown of the main differences between AoW3 and AoW:P:\n\nCities vs. Colonies:\nIn AoW3 you had cities that could collect resources from resource-generating nodes within their domain, with the domain gradually expanding outward as the city's population grew. The idea back then was to found a city with as many resource nodes within a 3 hex radius to maximize the city's economic bonuses.\nIn AoW:P, the map in divided into a sort patchwork grid of sectors. Instead of picking any hex on the map to found your colony, you instead found it on one of these sectors. As the colony grows, instead of having a domain around it which grows outward, you get to claim one of the adjacent sectors to the colony to exploit, up to a maximum of 4, and up to a distance of 2 sectors (i.e. up to the sectors next to the sectors next to the colony). The resources and bonuses you get from the exploited sectors depend on two things: 1. Resource nodes in the sector. 2. The type of exploitation you build on the sector, combined with the sector's terrain features. You can choose between 4 exploitation types, with a max of 2 of each type per colony: agriculture, production, energy (gold), and research. You can then upgrade the sector's exploitation by one level for each exploitation tier of that type you research (up to max of 2) and for each terrain feature compatible with the exploitation type you chose (e.g. \"Fertile Plains\" and \"Forest\" terrain features are compatible with the agriculture exploitation type) up to a maximum of level 5. The strategy here is to found your colonies near sectors with lots of exploitable terrain features that will allow you to maximally upgrade as few exploitation types as possible, as every upgrade to an exploitation type takes time to build, so you don't want to have to build too many. The idea here is to have every colony specialize in 2, or, at most, 3 exploitation types.\nAs you can tell by the difference in text length it takes to explain the two systems, AoW:P's colony system is not as intuitive or simple as AoW3's domain system, but you'll get the hang of it eventually.\n\nRaces and classes / factions and secret techs:\nIf there is anything in AoW:P that I can point to as being a significant improvement over AoW3, it's the factions, AoW:P's version of AoW3's races. Unlike in AoW3, where every race was nearly identical to the rest, with nearly the same unit structure (skirmisher, infantry, ranger, cavalry, mage, etc.) varying only in nominal stat/ability differences, AoW:P's factions are radically different from one another. While they all follow nearly the same unit tier and class system, the difference in functionality between each unit makes it so there is very little overlap between units across factions.\nAoW3's classes are replaced in AoW:P with \"secret techs\", which function pretty much the same way, giving you a few secret tech units, operations (magic), and mods.\n\nMods:\nSpeaking of mods, AoW:P allows you to equip not only your heroes, but your units too. The effects of these mods can range from a few passive stat boosts/augments to major changes (e.g. more damage, more armor, increased evasion, changed damage type, HP regeneration, new abilities, increased attack range, giving attacks AOE, giving attacks new status effects, etc.). With the right combination of mods, even a tier 1 unit can become a force to be reckoned with. The trick is that, aside from energy, AoW:P's basic \"money\" resource, they also cost \"Cosmite\", AoW:P's secondary resource, which is much harder to come by, and is used to build your more powerful tier 3 and 4 units, so you can't go hog-wild and mod all your units up the wazoo, no matter how high your energy income is.\n\nNeutral factions:\nAoW:P introduces another new feature: neutral factions. These are non-player factions that control a few sectors and numerous resource nodes on the map, that you can trade with using \"Influence\", another new resource, to get unique units, mods, and doctrines (operations that give you passive bonuses), or to politely ask them to vacate a resource node they're protecting. They will also occasionally give you mini quests that, if completed, improve your relationship with them and grant you a cache of resources (and sometimes a piece of equipment and/or a faction unit). The better your relationship with the faction, the cheaper it becomes to buy from them, and the more powerful units and items become available for purchase.\nAlternatively, you can decide you don't want to be friendly with a neutral faction, and go to war with them instead. This will allow you to claim their sectors and nodes by force, and give you a resource bonus for killing their units.\n\nAI:\nNow, if there is something I can point to in AoW:P as its weakness, it would be the AI. The AI in AoW:P is absolutely incompetent. Even on the highest difficulty level, in which the AI gets massive resource bonuses (i.e. cheats), I don't find winning especially difficult.\nIts strategic decision-making is highly questionable. It's needlessly belligerent towards its neighbors, randomly declares war on half the other players, then gets scared and hunkers down, and later asks for peace even when it's not advantageous for it to do so. I've been consistently able to win by means of the \"Doomsday\" victory condition, in which you need to build 3 super-weapon buildings, initiate the doomsday operation, and protect them for 10 turns. While doing this will make all AI's not aligned with you to declare war on you, it won't make them stop fighting among themselves long enough to stop you.\nIn combat, its behavior is absolutely moronic.\nIn AoW3, because a large part of the units were melee, and even most ranged units had penalties for attacking from max range, most battles were about closing in and trying to surround and outflank the enemy, which the AI was OK at.\nIn AoW:P, most units are ranged, and aside from more accuracy, there's generally little point in moving your units in for a close-quarters brawl. The AI seems to have a hard time wrapping its \"head\" around this concept, and will often charge in to use its units more potent abilities, letting you set up lethal kill-boxes on favorable terrain and catch them in a cross-fire. This is especially bad in colony attacks, where the AI's units will run head-long into your colony's defensive towers. Beside that, the AI doesn't try to create a unified \"front\" with its units to maximize damage output, and never groups up its army stacks in open field battle, letting you pick off its units one group at a time. Furthermore, in battles the AI is guaranteed to win (e.g. 4-to-1 force advantage in the open), it makes no effort to preserve its units, taking unnecessary damage and losses. Because of the AI's tactical weakness, I've been able to crush its armies even in battles where I was in a significant force disadvantage.\n\nEdit (05/12/2020):\nI've stopped playing the game since March of this year because of severe issues with the AI. The devs have made no progress in noticeably improving it since that time. Given this, I can not recommend this game.\n\nJust play AoW3 instead.", "timestamp_created": 1581764031, "timestamp_updated": 1607177542, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582718849182128906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "63532645": {"recommendationid": "63532645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039508906", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 18576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13704, "last_played": 1584395067}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.

Now Planetfall has come on the scene, promising deeper, more rewarding gameplay and a richer story, untethered to the clich\u00e9s of the fantasy genre. Although it\u2019s pleased enough Steam users to garner mostly positive reviews, I don\u2019t think Planetfall is worth the current asking price of US$50, so it\u2019s a Not Recommended from me. I currently have over 400 hours played and about half the achievements, including the coveted \u201cWololo,\u201d which is held by only 0.6% of players.\n\nThe formula of light 4X coupled with turn-based tactical battles worked like a charm in AOW3. Planetfall tinkers with this formula, placing greater emphasis on city building and associated management tasks. Gameplay feels much closer to modern incarnations of the Civilization franchise than to the familiar Heroes of Might and Magic / Civ hybrid from earlier AOW games. The attractive spell books have been replaced with massive tech trees that require constant vertical scrolling, and mostly-unbearable spoken quotes before each tech advancement. AOW3\u2019s map zoomed out to show a picturesque storybook map. Planetfall\u2019s is a dog\u2019s dinner of inkblot-shaped \u201csectors\u201d festooned with resource icons (just grab any sector with Cosmite, since you\u2019ll be starved for Cosmite from turn one until you quit playing). The complexity of the sector system can be confusing for new players, and Triumph\u2019s policy of constant tinkering means even seasoned players of the game won\u2019t always know how sectors work after the latest patch. As of this writing, an upcoming update promises to divide the map icons up into three different versions, navigated by tabs.\n\nAnd I miss the Book of Wonders. Searching the Imperial Archives just feels like Google.\n\nYou\u2019ll start off your city with structures like the central science lab and recreational dome, but soon enough you find yourself constructing abstract concepts like \u201cEnergy Sectors Upgrade\u201d and \u201cAgriculture Exploitation.\u201d You\u2019re spammed with insignificant notifications like \u201cX has insulted my kingdom!\u201d New metrics like Popular Support, Reputation, Alert Level and Casus Belli are thrown into the mix with familiar metrics like Race Relations, Morale, etc., resulting in a fog of statistical gibberish.\n\nLike the silly feature that lets you move each citizen of your city into different occupations, some of Planetfall\u2019s micromanagement can be automated and ignored, but doing so will lead to suboptimal results and might potentially lose the game for you.\n\nThis franchise really deserves a game with a coherent UI, but Planetfall\u2019s is catastrophic. Picking new attributes when a hero levels up in AOW3 was an absolute mess of tiny scrolling text, but Planetfall\u2019s method is identical, only the text is larger and they used a futuristic font.\n\nWhat about that storyline? Well, you\u2019re in the future, where some pan-galactic apocalypse has reduced everything to rubble, so everyone stands around inside ruined buildings on different planets, waiting for you to show up so they can start shooting.\n\nThere\u2019s apparently only one gender in the future. Let\u2019s refer to them as \u201cspace maureens.\u201d They have broad shoulders, muscular limbs and lean, masculine faces. Some are voiced by female actors, perhaps for diversity\u2019s sake. \n\nI\u2019m not one for graphics, but these character animations just don\u2019t make it look like a US$50 game. Defeated units tip over like a domino. The copious amounts of voice acting sound under-rehearsed and stilted. The one exception to this is the actor who narrates the tech advancements for the Syndicate, who sounds like Jon Irenicus. The musical score is generally excellent, my favorite track is the battle music that sounds like an Abba pop song.\n\nNow, on to the best part of all the Age of Wonders games, the combat. Planetfall brings some needed improvements (like displaying which enemies can be hit before you advance your ranged units), but it also streamlines and discards some really enjoyable elements from the previous game (like cutting the number of items your heroes can carry from 8 to a maximum of 6).\n\nIn an attempt to wean players away from spamming endless tier 3 units, Planetfall gives us some tier 1 units that can be improved throughout the game with progressively more powerful mods. Not sure what they\u2019ll do to stop us from spamming tier 1\u2019s now, but no doubt there\u2019s something around the corner.\n\nHero vehicles are an interesting idea, but they require too much advance planning and don\u2019t really feel like a big step up. And why does the hero portrait change to the vehicle itself?\n\nYou can\u2019t charm enemy heroes any more, a feature that I loved in the previous game. In one of my Planetfall games, a mind-controlled enemy hero reverted back to the enemy\u2019s side after the battle!\n\nFighting to a stalemate was always a long and tedious affair \u2013 necessary when one of your scouts get ambushed \u2013 but now the process is more boring since it takes 6 rounds of battle instead of 5.\n\nThe damn camera won\u2019t stay still! Every time I move a unit, it shifts a little bit. I\u2019m constantly zooming and rotating to get a good view of the battle.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know where the edge of some combat maps are, until you\u2019ve bumped up against them.\n\nA prerecorded \u201cdamnit!\u201d clip from Jack Gelder plays to inform you of your reaction to the death of your unit. Actually, I think these clips are included because it\u2019s so difficult to tell if a unit is dead or alive sometimes.\n\nFlying units are a great addition, I love how they integrate their abilities with ground troops, but it\u2019s agonizing to move them around. Everyone at Triumph should take a week off, shut off their internet and figure out how flying units can be moved. It\u2019s the only way, guys.\n\nHow is the campaign? I\u2019m not sure how they did it, but they took all these cataclysmic events and made them really boring. Somehow, the story of the Vanguard waking up from centuries of sleep to discover that their galactic empire has collapsed, was a yawn. The Kirkos\u2019 quest for their original homeworld is the only campaign that hit any dramatic chords. The Revelations campaign rehashes a lot of ideas from the main campaign \u2013 the planet is covered with network nodes and you must find them all while the Autonom shoot lasers at you. \n\nhttps://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/767224654521522556/8F8121149C8AFC506DF840648309B7A4D1EB6CF4/\n\nIn summary, Planetfall\u2019s good, but not as good as AOW3. If you like Civ style micromanagement, Planetfall\u2019s been patched to let you skip the battles and automate exploration, so you can dive right in. If you want to play Age of Wonders, maybe wait on this purchase and see how the game develops in future expansions.\n\nHopefully, I\u2019ll be able to one day return to this review with a more positive recommendation.

Maybe 5-10 were campaign, before I got bored of it. Decided to do scenario to just have AI battle fun, like I would in other 4x games. I maxed all the difficulties and ended up winning on turn 134 of 150. I didn't even understand a lot of the mechanics until I was much later in the game.\n\n I researched very haphazardly. Built my bases haphazardly. By the end I realized how much you can focus and how that can really change game. My base with the most production had no perks for units. The bases where I could make units for cheaper and start them with armor were never making units. I didn't realize that the places I captured without moving my population over would mean I can't build my own higher-tech units.\n\nI am still giving the game a thumbs up. The mechanics are actually great. I am seeing how I can play this with my friends because it's much more exciting than other 4x. I love the split between civic & military simultaneous researching. The tactical battles are great (although I wish defending AI didn't rush outside of their laser defense range). There are so many tactical options between perks for your government, ways to spy, and special abilities during battle. The economy seemed balanced properly so you couldn't really just go wild with the best units in the game. Lots of great stuff. It really just seems to fall over on AI. However if you haven't played many 4X in the past, it would still be a challenge. Like I said, I nearly ran out of time to win.

I'm looking forward to the sequel.\n\nI've not come across any bugs.  The races and tech trees are interesting.  The combat is fun.  However, they made some design decisions that I find extremely frustrating.  They've also failed to provide clear, concise, and easily accessible information about your cities.\n\nI've spent most of my time playing the campaign.  It feels like a minimum viable product.  For reference I'm comparing this game to X-com 1 and 2, the Total War games, Battletech, and Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.  \n\nMy biggest problem is with the tech tree and player choice.  If you capture a city that belongs to another race you get access to some of that race's technology.  You're able to research it yourself.  However, you only get access to some of it.  If their race uses different damage channels than you, you will not be able to research the appropriate tech, meaning that even though you can research and build their units, they will always be weak.  The result is that you cannot effectively field mixed armies.\n\nThere are also buildings that are in the society tree that you will never be able to build.  The first one that comes to mind is the Vanguard training building that gives 3xp per turn to any unit in the city.\n\nThey seem to have restricted the tech you get access to maintain the distinctiveness of each race.  I found this to be extremely annoying.  The factions in Alpha Centari all had their own unique quirks separate from the tech tree.  Here, everything seems to be dependent on it.\n\nIt seems to me it would be very easy for them to fix this, but because it appears to be a conscious design decision I doubt that they will.\n\nIn the campaign you do not carry your researched tech from world to world, and you often abandon one secret tech for another.  It makes sense to add a new secret tech between missions.  However, that's not what happens.\n\nI also found the way cities are done to be overly restricted.  Each city can have 4 sectors (6 or 8 with mods), however you can only have 2 of any individual kind of sector, including ocean sectors.   The result is that ocean bases are not viable and you are not able to maximize the output of your cities.  It seemed like the game was cockblocking everything I wanted to do.\n\nCompare that to Alpha Centari, where I felt free to do whatever I wanted, including hitting cities with nerve gas or black hole bombs that would blow massive holes in continents.\n\nThe tactical battles also need to be improved.  The first thing I would do is give the player the ability to deploy their units, just like you can in the Total War games.  I'd also increase the number of units you can have in one stack.  Six is extremely restrictive and limits your ability to engage in combined arms operations.\n\nIf they wanted to get really crazy they could abandon the flat map and use a sphere like in Planetary Annihilation and Phoenix Point.  Planetary Annihilation also has many maps with multiple worlds in the same system, with combat happening across the whole system.  Implementing that kind of a system in this game would set it apart from anything else in the space.\n\nIn summary, I'm excited for a sequel that gives unrestricted access to the tech tree (some gated behind, capturing enemy cities, reverse engineering destroyed units, map quests), improved tactical battles (choose your own deployment and more units), spherical world maps, and multiworld systems.  If they fix it, so the game stops cockblocking players it will be fun and I'll change my this to recommend.  But again, these seem to be conscious design decisions.  It seems unlikely to happen. \n\nIt would also be nice if they implemented a skirmish mode, where you could pick a map and units.  Then just have a tactical battle without having to play the campaign.", "timestamp_created": 1581239865, "timestamp_updated": 1581240400, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555173218250274658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "63198129": {"recommendationid": "63198129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067963800", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1838, "last_played": 1583027391}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1581224785, "timestamp_updated": 1581224785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "63148182": {"recommendationid": "63148182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239947088", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1467, "last_played": 1607148655}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the AoW series as a kid and spent plenty of hours on them, but this really hits my sci-fi interests.

There's a built in timer option for players like me who tend to take a lot of time between turns analyzing every move.  There is also a ticket system for manual strategic battles to all time to focus on all of the meaningful battles rather than on the small battles that the player will win easily.  \n\nThe strategic battles are great and is part of why the game shines for me.  Seeing your carefully crafted army composition with specified mods go toe to toe with others.

I expected a good strategic experience, but all I got was a dull story, bland gameplay, inferior AI, generic art design, and technical problems. \n\n[h1]Pros & Cons[/h1]\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list][*]The game offers quite a lot of units for each race, letting you do various army compositions. They are also very distinctive in their design and have a few gameplay differences. \n[*]You can customize units and heroes with modifications increasing their overall statistics and adding other special abilities.\n[*]The option to play battles manually adds much more fun to this genre.\n[*]You can customize your commanders' appearance.[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list][*]The story campaign is nothing but a skirmish mode with specific missions and awful storytelling.\n[*]In my experience, the AI acts stupidly and erroneously, especially on the world\u2019s map. It is better in the battles, but nothing extraordinary. \n[*]I could not immerse myself in this sci-fi universe because the design of races and units is generic, uninteresting, and grotesque. The same applies to story, lore, and dialogues. \n[*]There are a few questionable design decisions that deteriorate the gameplay experience on the world\u2019s map. \n[*]I had a problem with launching the game on Steam at first, which I had to repair by myself as the developers' advice was useless. Although it works now, every function that Steam offers (achievements, trading cards, Steam cloud) do not work for me. \n[*]I experienced a lot of frame drops, both on the world\u2019s map and during the combat. It is irritating even for a turn-based game. \n[*]Not the developer's fault, but I do not see a point in having the Paradox Launcher.[/list] \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay divides into two major parts: the world\u2019s map and battles. Your main goal is the same as in every other 4X game: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. \n\n[b]The world\u2019s map[/b] \n\nYou choose from six different races with unique designs, units, and gameplay elements. As it is custom, maps are procedurally generated, even in the campaign. You start the game with a small army and a city, where you construct buildings and upgrades for your sector. Sectors divide the whole map. They always have a specific place where you can build a base or a city. \n\nSectors also provide resources, such as energy, cosmite, food, knowledge, and production.\n\nThis whole system feels simplified because you do not build anything on the tiles as in the [i]Civilization[/i] series. You have no freedom in choosing a spot for a city. After a while, it is just a boring routine which you have to do. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1978713226\nYou interact with other civilizations which usually lead to a war that you want anyway because battles are the biggest strength of this game. The diplomacy system is almost the same as in the [i]Civilization[/i] series, and the AI has abnormally weird reasons to hate you. They often come up with \u201cexcellent\u201d tactical plans when you are at war, such as: attacking your city with a small group of units or dividing their forces so you can get them one by one.\n\nThere are also smaller AI factions that do not expand. They have an addiction that forces them to send you the very same quest requests over and over again. To stop their spamming, you need to destroy them. It is a test of patience as they attack you themselves after you reject them many times.\n\nThe campaign offers two missions for each race, and there is no reason to play it. It is just a limited skirmish with dull dialogues that pauses your game every single time. The writing is substandard even for strategy games. The skirmish mode is much more enjoyable as there is an absence of dialogues and you can customize the game with various settings.\n\n[b]Battles[/b]\n\nThe battles are turn-based, as in the [i]XCOM[/i] series. Each army has six unit slots which you fill however you want. Units have ranged or melee attacks, and also special abilities which are different for every faction. For example, Vanguard faction soldiers throw grenades, their robots use smokes for cover or heal allied units. The Psi-Fish faction I fought a lot uses hypnotic powers that take off the control of your units. \n\nThe units have up to three modifications slots. Modifications increase the stats of the units and add special abilities. For the mentioned Vanguard soldiers, you can increase their overall range and accuracy and ignoring the cover bonuses. \n\nUnits are distinguished into types and tiers. The unit type adds resistance and sensitivity to a certain damage type. There are unit types like biological, mineral, etc. There are four tiers. The higher tier units are stronger but costlier. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1978713639\nYou lead an army with a hero who is fully customizable. You can change their weapons and as they level up, you choose perks and other special abilities. Unfortunately, the perks are mostly about a higher percentage of health, accuracy, defense, etc. The metioned modifications can be used on heroes, as well.\n\nThere are special faction abilities you need to research first. They allow you to use barrages, lasers, heals, and other useful things on the battlefield. The battlefields\u2019 cover is destructible, and there are often explosives you can use to your advantage. \n\nI found the battles to be the most enjoyable part, as the AI is adequate and the diverse units, abilities, and modifications make it more interesting, and variable. \n\n[h1]Graphics, design, and soundtrack[/h1]\nI find the graphics underwhelming, even on the highest settings, for a 2019 game. The same unfortunately applies to the soundtrack. I honestly remember slightly just one composition. \n\nOn the other hand, graphics for me are secondary to design. Unfortunately, the designs of races, units, and the world overall are way too generic and uninteresting. There are some exceptions, but overall it is just a big mess. That is subjective, sure, but if the game fails to immerse me into the sci-fi universe, then there is something wrong with it. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1978714015\n[h1]Game\u2019s performance[/h1]\nThe game was tested on [b]i5 8300H, GTX 1060 6GB, 8GB RAM, and an SSD[/b]. I had several frame drops, both on the world\u2019s map and in the battles. I locked the game on 60 frames and the drops in the worst cases went to 20-30 frames. These drops were random, and I have not found the source of them. I have not had such inconsistent framerates with other big releases this year.\n\nI also could not launch the game at first through Steam. I found out that I did not have the executable files required for starting the game. I unsuccessfully tried every advice from developers. I found a solution by downloading the game via the Paradox Launcher and playing it there. But as I had to write a review, I had to find a way to play it on Steam. I will leave a guide in the comments.\n\nWith that comes the aligned problem, that the game does not register Steam achievements, trading cards, or cloud.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[i]Age of Wonders: Planetfall[/i] is not the worst strategy game out there. It offers quite a lot of content and replayability. However, I cannot recommend it for all its faults and problems I had. Even if I was to look past the technical issues I experienced, I still could not think of a single reason why I would recommend this game over any other series, such as [i]Civilization, Total War, XCOM[/i], and others. I would wait for a huge sale to buy this game, as I think the price of 50\u20ac is not adequate. \n\n[quote][b]This product was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free.[/b][/quote]\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7871885/][quote]Follow our curator page, [b]OCG-Curations[/b], if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.", "timestamp_created": 1579962760, "timestamp_updated": 1580503996, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 83, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657198429107666016", "comment_count": 36, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "62315449": {"recommendationid": "62315449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009375655", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 11040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4262, "last_played": 1614000270}, "language": "english", "review": " .", "timestamp_created": 1579856006, "timestamp_updated": 1579856006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.3926888108253479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "62297360": {"recommendationid": "62297360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007040556", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1514, "last_played": 1581826752}, "language": "english", "review": "i like it.", "timestamp_created": 1579820381, "timestamp_updated": 1579820381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.3926888108253479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "62280937": {"recommendationid": "62280937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006715342", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 410, "last_played": 1582311750}, "language": "english", "review": "First, let me say that Paradox has done something here that I didn't think they were capable of: they created a game that launches quickly!

Hopefully we can help you."}, "62157258": {"recommendationid": "62157258", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964636276", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 49684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 700, "playtime_at_review": 8080, "last_played": 1619277073}, "language": "english", "review": "Really solid 4x.  one more turn..,", "timestamp_created": 1579560545, "timestamp_updated": 1579560545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "62100009": {"recommendationid": "62100009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031992516", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 301, "last_played": 1579467944}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a good, engrossing game!", "timestamp_created": 1579458609, "timestamp_updated": 1579458609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "62093867": {"recommendationid": "62093867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205990643", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4071, "last_played": 1595044348}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game\n", "timestamp_created": 1579450619, "timestamp_updated": 1579450619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "62057497": {"recommendationid": "62057497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031410179", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 3088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1603507770}, "language": "english", "review": "The tutorial hard crashes about once every 10 minutes, requiring me to restart my machine.

Then those skills should get added to the left side and you can review which ones you bought by going back into upgrades and checking the \"Learned\" drop-down.

I liked the Elves, Orcs and fantasy stuff like that, so it is a bit different to play Planetfall. I liked the way the story more or less continues in every new version and AoW 3 had an open ending, so I really hope someday they\u2019ll finish the story of Julia and Merlin.\n\nSo, back to this game. The story is a bit weird. The races are weird. I feel like being thrown in a world with a history I don\u2019t know, a way of thinking I don\u2019t really like and choices that are not mine. In AoW 3 it started, the way units look on screen is a bit of a mess. Maybe it\u2019s making more sense, but in AoW 1 \u2013 2.5 an archer for example is a single unit. That unit is detailed enough to see the features like a face and a weapon. In AoW 3 when you build a unit you\u2019ll end up with like 3 units on a single tile. Only when you zoom in you can see how they look. In Planetfall it\u2019s even worse! When I\u2019m in a battle I see small blurry figures jumping other blurry figures. Everything is so small! I really don\u2019t like the style since AoW 3.\n\nSo\u2026 something happened to the universe, everything that didn\u2019t die became something like an cyborg, an insect or jellyfish. The Amazones are like the druid/elves, so the \u2018old\u2019 races are more or less there, but pretty different.\n\nI do recommend this game because it is fun to play. I don\u2019t enjoy is as much as I did with the old AoW\u2019s (Shadow Magic is still my favorite) The research tree\u2019s are nice, the city building is more complex, the world is dark but beautiful. I also like the little stories in the detail window of the units.

I do prefer the battles much more in Planetfall however; mostly because of the cover system.  It's almost like an X-Com type of battle system with half cover and full cover.\n\nThe 6 initial factions seem to be well thought out and are very diverse in the way they play.  The units are also unique and possess their own strengths, weaknesses, and most have their own special abilities.  I do highly recommend getting the Revelations DLC, although a little pricey for what you get, because it adds quite a bit of flavor to the map, including some \"Choose your own path\" type of quests, which were a welcomed addition.  With that being said, imo that should have been included out of the box.\n\nThe controls are responsive and the UI is well thought out.  I initially purchased this for the PS4 but subsequently traded that in and purchased it for the PC as the controls are much better with a mouse, which is all you need.  I play on my TV, so the ability to use a keyboard etc isn't really feasible.  Luckily, the game plays well using just the mouse for campaign and battles alike.\n\nMy only criticism is that of the diplomacy.  It isn't very fleshed out imo.  There are the typical non aggression, defensive alliance, alliance as well as trades etc but the method seems a little too simplistic and predictable.  You can instantly raise an opponent's impression of you by spending 100 influence to compliment them.  That automatically raises their opinion by 100.  Do that for a few turns and everyone likes you.  I did that and subsequently had an alliance with 4 of the 6 remaining factions.  Took the other two's capital's and it was Victory for the 4 of us at turn 128.  \n\nOther than the diplomacy (Which I hope they revamp in upcoming patches), I do highly recommend this game.  There is a lot to do, a lot of diversity and now even additional ways to victory to add some flavor.

Basically you have to make bad moves and sacrifice units just to get the AI to move or anything! you have to do what the way the AI wants you to do unless it only has melee units which isn't the case a lot of the time! whenever i see the AI do this in a strategy game i make an audible groan because it's bullshit and you cannot out wait an AI's patience because it has no concept of being impatience and will wait you out until your unwillingly make a bad move on purpose. This is also the case in divinity original sin 2 with the alligators in act 1 refusing to move at ALL because the AI knew my unit has ranged attacks but also knew they could tank the dmg easily but just wanted to gang bang one party member to death first rather than taking dmg that would take one of it's 4-5 alligators down to half hp WHICH BTW one of them could teleport itself and your guys into a gator mosh pit. \n\nSo in short the AI will play cheap and dirty by waiting you out.\n\nsecondly the Character creation is cheap and shallow, a lot of the out fits don't colour well, for some reason all the male humans are old and wrinkle with no youthful [strike] twink [/strike] faces even though there is a slider to add aged creases to faces which make the men look even older which is bullshit as the women get way more faces some looking like they're 18-20 years old even or even young males with some of them. All the alien races that aren't humans customisation are lack luster especially the assembly only having metal dread locks and nothing else with limbs just being human limbs but metal instead of giving interesting limbs like hook hands, blade feet, two fingers and a single thumb or  giving metal bodies technological stylised differences like for example portal robot parts being all clean looking, steampunk robot parts, greek metal works and super clean android......etc.\nThey should of put more effort and time in the character creation as im pretty sure it's huge selling point of the series instead of being lazy and relying on the community to do their job for them again like come the fuck on guys seriously.\n\nThe UI is awful why is end turn so small and shit is so hard to find and making shit is just annoying to do like seriously did you guys do any QA testing and no just because you guys got used to it during the game development doesn't mean it's good or practical it means you got too lazy to change it.\n\nalso being able to redo combat again to avoid ur losses is lame.\n\nthe game look visually good the environments are nice, the non-commander units look good and the sound design is good.\n\nin short don't buy this game it's clearly rushed and just play AoW 3 instead", "timestamp_created": 1577930912, "timestamp_updated": 1577930912, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494819372892379761", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "61097417": {"recommendationid": "61097417", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977555392", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1585153440}, "language": "english", "review": "Civ6 + XCOM", "timestamp_created": 1577920747, "timestamp_updated": 1577920747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "61088759": {"recommendationid": "61088759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110940109", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 48956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 253, "playtime_at_review": 1632, "last_played": 1618682690}, "language": "english", "review": "Mix of Heroes, Civ BTE in Sci-fi setting.

Moreover, the early game economy will always be a challenge, as you try to find a way to snowball into the late game, but otherwise I recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1577263113, "timestamp_updated": 1577263113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531914889812469482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "60451286": {"recommendationid": "60451286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017589341", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 233, "last_played": 1586090864}, "language": "english", "review": "King of 4X games.", "timestamp_created": 1577188438, "timestamp_updated": 1577188438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "60442840": {"recommendationid": "60442840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060365664", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 15058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9743, "last_played": 1599846264}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good game. \n\nI really tried to like AoW III but it had massive high tier units spawn and boring cities.\n\nAoW Planetfall improved on all aspects imho.

This is enhanced by the \"secret technology\" system where each player can choose (caveat: in the campaign, the choice is made ahead of time) an extra tech tree that further builds a unique identity and playstyle.\n\nThe combat itself is the highlight of the game.

They have abandoned the game now, and haven't even bothered to provide rollback betas, forcing players to go through a grueling manual process to play the older versions without the crashes.\n\n--\n\nThis said, I love the developer Triumph Games, so I'm going to evaluate the game on its own merit.\n\nGreat strategy game. If you've never played the Age of Wonders series, they are 4X games with a focus on strategic and tactical combat, aided by spells (or in this game, operations) that you can cast directly on the tactical or strategic map within your zone of influence. Tactical combat is deep (and got deeper since AOW3 with the addition of flanking and other mechanics) and excellent, and there's a big focus on leveling up and equipping your units.\n\nEvery game in the series is also notable for being great to play in coop multiplayer (random maps, not the campaign) because turns are simultaneous, which works perfect when you're working together and want to wait for each other as little as possible. Manual battles can slow things down unless you enforce autocombat at all times, but this title introduces an optional allotment of \"battle cards\" which makes manual combat a limited-availability item you want to use wisely. \n\nI was initially skeptical about Triumph making a Sci-Fi title, but they did an amazing job at making each faction feel fleshed out, with interesting lore that is well integrated into the campaign. Some races are downright terrifying, but at the same time everything is treated with a light humorous tone which I really appreciate. The Campaign is well-narrated with interesting characters you grow to like, and there are mutually exclusive choices to make, that can even affect future missions. One very nice touch when you get a quest is that the game tells you whether you can accomplish it by sending scouts, or if you actually need to bring an army - it saves you from awkward moments and wasted time.\n\nThe graphics really deserve a mention. Both the world map and the various tactical maps are absolutely gorgeous, and represent a big improvement over the previous installment - this is the best an Age of Wonders game has ever looked in terms of assets quality, though I still have a soft spot for the treasure map-like pixel art dreamscapes of AOW I/II/Shadow Magic. Animations are not up to the same level of quality, but by 4X game standards, they're pretty good.\n\nOf particular note are the minor factions, that don't act like a player but rather give you quests and make demands to gain favor with them. Not only do they have a lot of flavour and personality, they also have rivalries with other minor factions and will try to make you pick sides. They're like a way more fun version of city-states in Civ V/VI. Gain enough favor and you can purchase their units and unique items, or even annex their sectors, by spending precious influence points.\n\nAnother element that's a bit Civ-like is the tech trees: gone are the randomized research options from all past games. Even unlocking faction units is now done through the tech tree, as opposed to simply building a sequence of buildings in a city. This makes it easier to pursue a specific strategy, but as someone who tends to suffer from analysis paralysis, I found the randomized research options in past titles liberating due to the limited amount of choices.\n\nThe economy is well-conceived and well-balanced, you'll never feel like you have too much of the various resources, forcing you to make choices every step of the way.\n\nA rather large difference compared to past titles is that the map is pre-divided into randomly named sectors which you can annex to your cities as they grow, or build forward military outposts on. I think it's a good mechanic gameplay-wise, and just like the auto-expanding city domains in AOW3, it removes the need to \"walk\" on every resource-producing structure to capture it like you had to do in older AOW or HOMM games. However it detracts quite a bit from the \"organic\" and \"treasure map\" aspect of past titles, and I dare to say that some of the \"Wonder\" in Age of Wonders is gone. The fact that you most often colonize rather than rely on capturing neutral cities of various races doesn't feel as fun, either - I find building settlers boring in Civ and it's even more boring here, contrasted with the overall focus on military power.\n\nMaps are still very big and missions rather long, though definitely not as much as the monster campaign missions in AOWII. There's no underworld or parallel dimension, at least so far - makes it easier to see everything at a glance, but reduces the feeling of adventure a bit.\n\nSome flavor was perhaps lost compared to titles like AOW due to terraforming being a lot less common, and so far the absence of spel... sorry, operations, that place obstacles (poison plants, ...) on the map. It made you feel pretty powerful.\n\nA bigger loss is certainly that scouting the map and picking up various resources is now rather boring (they did introduce auto-explore post-launch). Except the very rare occasional random event, you have three types of stashes to pick up with always the same flavour text. You also don't really get little nooks and crannies that feel very hand-designed and fun to explore, like the small underground or very thematic areas of past games. That's the cost of playing on a larger scale and on procedurally generated instead of hand-made maps I suppose - what we gain in replayability, we lose in character and detail. There's still the thrill of discovering which factions are on the map in campaign missions, thankfully, but I don't find myself looking forward to what cool areas of the map I'll be able to find, like I used to do in AOWII and Shadow Magic.\n\nNitpicks:\n- The zoom when you get a quest is very annoying. Missions are often timed but this view prevents you from seeing what units you have nearby to evaluate if you can complete the quest, and you can't close the screen and come back to it - only way to close it is by accepting or refusing.\n- The campaign tends to shove very important decisions in your face which you have to make on the spot - no way to save or look at the map beforehand.\n- When you have a lot of colonies and mostly winning, picking what to build tends to become samey and tedious. Some optional auto-management of colonies would be appreciated.\n- Unless I missed some subtle color-coding or other non-obvious hint, tactical combat doesn't do a great job at helping you evaluate which enemies you'll be able to reach with secondary abilities if you move to a given hex. Having to count hexes manually is pretty annoying.\n- If I understand correctly, there are no hand-made skirmish maps? If so this is a big loss compared to past games, having random maps is great for long-term replayability, but sometimes you just want to play on something nicely hand-designed. Hopefully the community were given the means to plug this gap.\n\nOverall though, this is a fascinating, deep and addictive game, which will take you dozens of hours just to explore all aspects of the economic and military systems, and way more to master them and find your favorite strategies.

I like it. It's different than the previuos games in many regards, but most, if not all major changes, are IMHO for the better.\n\nIf you like any TBS games, check this one out.\n\n========EDIT==========\n\nAfter spending more time with the game, here's an actual review:\n\nFirst of all, I really don't like it when people compare this game to 4X games. I guess technically it is, but it's closer in style to Fantasy General, HoMM, or in fact the previous Age of Wonders games. It's a tactical wargame first and foremost, with a strategic side added on top. That's not a bad thing, just don't expect Civilization: Beyond Earth or Alpha Centauri.\n\nThe game takes place in a Fantasy/Sci-Fi setting, somewhat reminiscent of the Warhammer 40K universe, just much, MUCH less grimdark. After the fall of the Star Union, a Universe-spanning empire of humans, the remnants are left to be picked up by several warring factions, ranging from expeditionary forces of the old Union, through Merchant Houses from Dune, Space Dwarves, Borg wannabes to insectoid aliens. The setting is filled with familiar tropes, which helps to quickly get familiar with the different factions.\n\nThe core gameplay focuses on tactical battles (this time I have to express my displeasure for comparisons to X-com. The battles are turn-based, and some units have ranged overwatch. That's it for X-com similarities). The fights are brutal, are focused around exploiting unit weaknesses and synergies. The base game has 5 damage types and three (technically four, but one is not listed on the character sheet - Triumph, please show the dodge chance a unit has, ok?) types of defenses which a player must learn to recognize and know how to use to be successful. Each unit has a special ability (most actually have two), there are heroes who function as army leaders or really powerful units. You also have tactical operations to use in battle, which function like spells from previous entries, and strategic operations to hinder your enemies or benefit your armies and cities on the world map. And TBH, that's a very brief summary of the intricacies of the war mechanic of this game and I'm sure I've missed a key feature or two.\n\nA key new addition to the series, and one of my favorite features, is unit modding. Each unit and hero has three slots for special mods gained through research, from allied NPC factions or (in the case of heroes) found through exploring. They can be as simple as a stat boost, to change how a unit's ability works or giving the unit a new ability entirely. It's a lot of fun trying out different combinations, or experimenting with combinations you haven't tried yet.\n\nThere is also research, city management, diplomacy, questing, and ruin explorations but while important, it is very simple actually, and quite standard for most strategy games nowadays. Generally speaking, if you enjoy playing as a warmonger in other strategy games, then this game is for you as warmongering is the default. And although there is a 'Pacifist' and Scientific victory condition, you will get into a lot of battles simply through exploring and questing. \n\nFinally the Audio-Visual design. The music is very subdued, even during fights, but enjoyable none the less. The battle sounds are serviceable, but no unit VO except for simple grunts. The voice acting in the cutscenes, the quotes after you finish a research project, or your advisors are hit and miss: some are fine (I especially enjoy the Insectoid Kir'ko) but some are dreadful (the Vanguard humans have it the worst I think). Graphics are clear and colorful, but some animations are prone to bugging out or are poorly synced with the sounds. Not the prettiest game, but at least you can turn on very fast animations, so you'll miss most of the bugs and the battles are faced paced.\n\nAll in all a great game. Highly recommended. Plus, the developers are clearly passionate about it and are constantly supporting it with DLC and patches, that do more than just fix simple glitches.", "timestamp_created": 1576083038, "timestamp_updated": 1588077864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501246929168701172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "59668018": {"recommendationid": "59668018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007559846", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 25071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9607, "last_played": 1616962943}, "language": "english", "review": "AoW: Planetfall is a lot of fun.

The factions are all interesting and alter your gameplay choices, the sector system is an interesting take in the 4X genre and forces the player to be a bit more tactical about placing colonies, and the manual/tactical combat system makes for some really fun battles to break up the campaign map management. I will say, that while the 6 unit limit for an army does keep things closer to fair, when you can bring 4 or 5 such army stacks to bear against a single stack it gets overwhelming very quickly. Though I will say that some of my most memorable battles were when I was completely outnumbered and forced a pyrrhic victory on my opponents. 4 stacks of enemies walked in, and only one walked out.

It looks okay. But at best, it is civilisation light and that is being kind.  It misses the absolutely fundamental aspect which gives civilisation longevity.

I never thought they would be my faction of choice, I usually gravitate to more melee focused tanky factions. However, theres something about creating fire lanes and overlapping arcs of fire that takes me back to when I was in the army. The full novelty of this is using those same modern day tactics, then adapting them to combat strange alien life forms who have unusual abilities.\n\nThe ability to \"mod\" units fixes a problem that older AoW games had, being that low tier units would be wiped out easily by higher tier units. With mods, even a lowly infantry unit can turn into something greater with the right loadout. Of course, your enemy can do the same thing, creating an arms race where you adapt your loadouts based on what enemies you fight.\n\nI found the new map and sector system a bit jarring at first, very different to the old style of strategic gameplay, however after a few hours I feel like it suits the new setting well. I will say the map's geography don't seem to \"flow\" as naturally as they did in AoW3 (which has one of the best random map generators I've ever seen IMO). It definitely looks nice though.\n\nI enjoy the new Landmark system as well, gives you specific areas to aim for when expanding. Some of the designs look really nice too.\n\nTactical combat is amazing as always. This time around a lot more emphasis on cover, creating fire lanes, arcs of fire, tactical movement and ranged combat. Melee still exists but it isn't the focus like it was with previous games. Operations give combat a nice edge to it too, the air strikes and such remind me of the old pc game \"World in Conflict\" where you would launch strikes on locations to tip the balance of skirmishes around the map.\n\nOverall excellent game, I'll definitely be racking up the hours with this.

Things like \"end turn doesn't end turn\", \"game queue freezes waiting for you to click even though you shouldn't have to\", and inability to skip/hide info events (even though tutorial says you can), etc.  Or \"each race has the same tech tree, units, equipment, and weapons outside colors or other meaningless differences\".

Id like to deviate and say how awsome the developers are as well, a few years ago i had a weird bug where if i sold any items i found in AOW3 my game would hard crash. A developer reached out to me and added me and spent weeks working with me, communicating back in forth with other developers and trying to pinpoint the issue all while off the clock at times on his free time from his house. Note: these guys are in Europe, so are not on US time. I know this doesnt pretain to the gameplay but that meant a lot because i really loved that game and it was resolved finally. That to me speaks volumes, But back on point to the game play. I love the new races, the tech tree, every race has so much flavor and i really dont see any unit being cookie cutter. The amount of synergy with mods which are your way of upgrading your units is incredible. My fav was a xenoplague playthrough as the Kirko and i had the Barrager with the mod that makes the enemies corpses explode on death while further spreading disease and aoe damage, while also on death they became tier 1 growth tendril units. It was insane and by far my fav synergy. Overall this is a game you can buy and play scenario mode and customize your own planets and play for hundreds of hours easily.

All aspects of gameplay: from expansion and strategic decision to combat is very well polished.\n\nWhen it comes to variety, Planetfall has six main factions, which you are allowed to customize further through specializing in one of several secret technologies.\n\nPlanetfall also gives you ability to choose your leader\u2019s gender and appearance. Character customization is, admittedly, very basic by RPG standards, but it is still more than nearly every other strategy game offers.\n\nPlanetfall also has light RPG elements: your leader and heroes you hire level-up and you can pick abilities for them. Here is where I feel Planetfall falls a little short comparing to other strategy/RPG hybrids. The list of abilities is fairly limited, and best abilities are very obvious, so you will likely develop all your heroes very similarly, with slight variation based on their faction. Some extra variety will still come in form of heroes\u2019 equipment, though, as well as need for some heroes to fill a different role, such as sniper.\n\nI fully recommend this game to everyone who likes 4X strategies or want to give this genre a try.", "timestamp_created": 1575272988, "timestamp_updated": 1575273052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504189968109130859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "58993515": {"recommendationid": "58993515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089729088", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1446, "last_played": 1566408372}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1575267258, "timestamp_updated": 1575267258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "58986564": {"recommendationid": "58986564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070394899", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1296, "last_played": 1613778443}, "language": "english", "review": "So much fun!", "timestamp_created": 1575260962, "timestamp_updated": 1575260962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "58983842": {"recommendationid": "58983842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026071396", "num_games_owned": 1104, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3190, "last_played": 1615143161}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredibly replayable turn-based strategy game with rpg elements.\n\nYou choose a race and technology combination to make your faction during the match.\n\nYour choice determines your research, unit selection, as well hero skills and unit upgrades.\n\nHighly recommended if you have enjoyed other games in this style, such as various Heroes of Might and Magic, Alpha Centauri, or other Age of Wonders games.", "timestamp_created": 1575258602, "timestamp_updated": 1575258602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "58972423": {"recommendationid": "58972423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000855823", "num_games_owned": 523, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 930, "last_played": 1574998955}, "language": "english", "review": "I always auto-resolve battle, as I have larger numbers.

Same as the rest of the Age of Wonders series, except with a Sci-fi theme (which I love).\n\nLet's get to why this game is good. The battles are a lot more engaging than Endless Legend. It\u2019s XCOM but with a large variety of aliens and factions. IE, there are aliens that resist heat, which allows you to walk over lava. There are fliers, rocks, abominations, mind controllers, pirates etc. The cover system and the flanking system both add a lot of decisions by themselves, but add overwatch, a variety of effects and you got yourself a really engaging couple of hours. The combat also allows you to SEE these factions in a way that a strategic layer just can\u2019t provide. It\u2019s just awesome to watch these abilities in action like a giant colossus throwing a giant meteor on your units, having to wear biohazard suits for a poisonous swamp, battling insects attacking a frontier outpost etc. It also does a decent job of tying the battles to the larger empire using \u201ctactical operations\u201d that make your battles seem larger than the small scale affair they are. I like being able to call down orbital laser strikes and valkyries in the middle of the battle. I just wish there was more map variety. Some of the unique maps are pretty cool tho. \n\nHowever, if you are a fan of strategy games like me, the strategic layer will leave you sorely disappointed. Like most 4X games, the beginning is shrouded in mystery, the unknown. In this game, your decisions seem relatively simple. As the mystery disappears, you should be left with with an intricate and complicated system, but I just found it to be just as simple as the beginning. It took me a while to get into the game just because how disappointed I was at the empire building aspect of it. For example, [i]Endless Legend[/i] will force you to research technologies to find new and and advanced materials, and then build mines to generate the various metals, which allows for higher tier weapons require ever higher tier materials. Here you only have one special one. EL also requires you to build buildings that changes things in the map and how your cities look, just researching the technology doesn\u2019t do much. But here, all you need to do is grab a sector and clear a couple of baddies and that\u2019s really it. The city building was meager affair, and I felt a simple plan of expand aggressively and grab cosmite would get me 90% of the way there.  Disappointing for an empire building strategy game.\n\nThe strategic maps are also random and not very interesting. They do the job of keeping your guys moving and trying to organize your sectors, but there is no sense of world building for me. No plate tectonics, no continents, etc.  I don\u2019t get a lot of pleasure looking at it. I think the idea is that you barely look at the strategic layer and just get to the meat of the game: the battles. I just wish there was more.\n\nIt would be awesome if they align the strategic AI with the units themselves. IE, there is a minor faction that basically mind control your dudes. Lower units remove the ability to use weapons, higher tiers can straight up control them and lay eggs on them. It would be really interesting if they start doing that to your citizens, not just in combat, depending on how the diplomacy goes. But I think that's still far in the future. Overall, the diplomacy is a fairly simple affair with a simple influence point system to compliment and trade with factions.. It does have racial relations and various other gimmicks, but it\u2019s pretty straightforward and doesn\u2019t do anything more than other strategy games.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting game with a lot of cool things to offer. It\u2019s definitely worth a look. If it also had a strong strategic layer, I would be much more excited. And if it could do proper large scale combat\u2026 man, it would be the best strategy game yet.", "timestamp_created": 1574906495, "timestamp_updated": 1574919296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732037603855133057", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "58332529": {"recommendationid": "58332529", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985904075", "num_games_owned": 633, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 12838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11318, "last_played": 1608634220}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game.\n\nIt's a perfect length 4x.

It's difficult not to compare the two given their similarities, but in a few words - Planetfall's art may be a bit muddier and less cohesive than AoW3's, due to the mishmash sci-fi setting, but in gameplay terms Planetfall feels like an overall improvement, with more interesting NPC factions, cleaner and more manageable empire management, and just as much great tactical combat.\n\nOverall, Planetfall is one of my favourite recent 4X games. The colourful setting is great fun to play around in, and the \"one more turn\" feeling is very strong with this game. The tactical combat is fun to engage in when you want to, and the auto-resolve is pretty reasonable if you want to skip tactics and focus on rampant imperialism instead. The narrative and setting are interesting, borrowing heavily from space opera and planetary romance tropes rather than the usual dry and boring hard sci-fi settings so many space games get saddled with. Customizing your faction through the twin axes of Faction and Secret Tech (both of which provide units, mods, etc) remains a solid mechanic that adds a lot of variety.\n\nThere's really only one thing I'd complain about, aside from the slightly less distinctive art style, and that's the fact that you can't fully absorb NPC factions. Even when you've maxed out your reputation with them and absorbed their territory, you still need to go get their units from them by spending influence points. I miss the way AoW3 did things, where they just became a city in your empire on-par with the others.\n\nBut aside from that?

Sitting down and having an absolute blast with that game for hours on end. I can say the latest addition to the series has rekindled those fond memories, even if the setting has changed.\n\nThe game itself is your basic 4X game, eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. You'll start with a single city, a hero, and a contingent of troops. If you are familiar with the genre, it is a pretty straightforward affair of what you would expect from a game in this genre. Gain resources and territory, then smash your enemies.\n\nIf this is your first 4X game, this is not a bad place to start. Each turn you'll gain resources that you can use to build improvements in your cities or produce more soldiers. Your armies will get to move and attack so many times per turn, so you will have to plan out your moves to achieve your goals. You'll also be able to conduct diplomacy and research technology.\n\nEach city has it's own production queue, so you can focus a city on being say a massive science center, while another is churning out armies to do your bidding, while another is filling your coffers with credits to keep the whole thing moving smoothly. As your cities grow, you'll be able to annex surrounding areas, which then can be exploited to fit your city's needs. Want more food? Annex the plains that are rich with farms, etc. This not only makes city placement important for maximizing bonuses, but it also means that you can ensure you can focus on what you want.\n\nThe star of the series is the tactical battles themselves when push comes to shove. Those armies then drop onto a Tactical Map where each turn will let you move your individual units, use special abilities and the like. This plays out similar to games like XCOM, and you'll find yourself taking cover or shooting gas barrels to your advantage. With the variety of factions and technology, you'll see everything from cybernetically enhanced dinosaurs to mind controlling ghosts.\n\nOverall recommendation is that I recommend Age of Wonders: Planetfall.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Everything you'd expect from the Age of Wonders Franchise.\n    [*]Unit customization allows you to capitalize on your strengths, or your enemy's weaknesses.\n    [*]Tactics actually work better than just smashing units with the highest ATK and DEF at one another.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Minor Faction Quests get repetitive.\n    [*]While armies feel different between factions, city building feels too similar.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Ugly[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]No Space Cat Faction. :P\n[/list]\n\n[h1]System Specs[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K Processor @ 4.40GHz\n    [*]CPU Cooler: Corsair H100i\n    [*]GPU: GeForce GTX 970 G1 Gaming\n    [*]Memory: Corsair Vengeance 32GB\n    [*]OS: Windows 10 Pro\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1574807568, "timestamp_updated": 1574807568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "57994024": {"recommendationid": "57994024", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983814493", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7407, "last_played": 1593980231}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441, \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c!", "timestamp_created": 1574807558, "timestamp_updated": 1574807558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "57993924": {"recommendationid": "57993924", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970952779", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 623, "last_played": 1574880155}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool TBS game, like the old Age of Wonders, and Master of Magic!", "timestamp_created": 1574807534, "timestamp_updated": 1574807534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "57987284": {"recommendationid": "57987284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052653778", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 109954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2831, "playtime_at_review": 2593, "last_played": 1618848257}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, although it can get a little boring when it's just diplomacy going on.", "timestamp_created": 1574806116, "timestamp_updated": 1574806116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51890033483505249", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "57986082": {"recommendationid": "57986082", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970402796", "num_games_owned": 565, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 5241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2411, "last_played": 1618004237}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

My wife and I are big fans.\n\n(Note: To be clear as far as this review goes, my experiences with PF and all past AOW games are either campaign/skirmish or multiplayer allied with humans vs AI, usually 2 humans, sometimes 3 or 4.)\n\nThis review isn't for people who are concerned with the viability of late game synergies between crazy combinations of races/techs/mods or the balance nightmare that is sure to be.  I am writing this for people who, like us, were kind of on the fence about whether or not we would like this game.  This review assumes you have played one or more of the AOW franchise, or at the very least have a solid understanding of TBS games with tactical TBS combat.\n\nI held off on this purchase because I was kind of lukewarm on the whole move to Sci-Fi thing... I love Sci-Fi, and I knew that Triumph would do a great job no matter what, but I just wasn't personally super excited about the new genre and when PF launched I wasn't in the TBS mood.  The sale, as well as the weather cooling off, and most importantly my wife pushing it (She's not a big Sci-Fi fan) saw us pick it up this weekend, and we put about 10 hours into it.\n\n1.  The Graphics - AOW has always done a fantastic job here, not just from a raw eye-candy standpoint, but in using every tool at their disposal to really set a theme, mood, and feeling.  Planetfall is no exception.  The AOW3 engine has been upgraded significantly (or at least been cranked up to match modern computer specs) and the effects and animations are very nice.  The various races and extreme variety in locations have been expertly crafted to convey a living, breathing world filled with ancient secrets and dangers.  The static backgrounds and portraits all benefit from the new engine abilities, with lighting effects and greater clarity.  This in particular seems like a big improvement over AOW3's character stances/facial expressions/etc.\n\n2.  The Sound - It's easy to miss this in the sea of everything else that is going on for an incredibly busy turn-based experience, but the sounds are very good.  There has always been a really impressive visceral impact in AOW games when the metal meets the meat, so to speak, and PF carries this forward into the higher-tech realm.\n\n3.  The Music - As I mentioned before, I am a fan of the music of this entire series to the degree that I purchased the soundtracks separately.  How the music would be affected by the genre shift was really a concern, and while I was really hoping to see \"Love and Death\" transcend the space-time barrier along with some of the other core mechanics, I must say that the music is 100% Age of Wonders.  Van Den Bos has done a fantastic job here, you can hear a familiar underscore but the music nails the theme in a new way.  For me, in long-burn TBS games the music is vital to the experience, and for Planetfall it is certainly a high-point.\n\n\nSummary of basic gameplay/changes:\n\n1.  The core is still AOW.  \n     -Combat is still AOW.  If you made the jump from AOW/SM/AOW2 to AOW3's complexity in combat, the jump from \n      AOW3 to PF is about the same.  Cover matters, most units have either a charge/leap or a ranged attack, and then all \n      the various status effects/resistances that make of the layers of the tactical onion.\n\n     -The Overland Core (4X game if you want) is still AOW.  Play the tutorial, you know most of it already, but the colony \n     sectors/specializations are new and important, as are forward bases and militia (Militia is a fantastic change, btw, all \n     colonies/sectors/bases have an upgrade-able defense force that allows you to focus less on garrisons)\n\n2.  The races will take some time to learn.  For Fantasy-fans, this will be one of the tougher jumps, not just because it is sci-fi, but because there are a lot of units/races that defy the standard Sci-Fi norms, or mix several together.  This is a good thing but can take some getting used ti.\n\n3.  Mods are vital, both for your own troops as well as from a \"Know Your Enemy\" standpoint.  My wife got into a turn-based battle that was marked \"Low Risk\"... she wiped her veteran 6 stack against a modded group of 4 on a spawner.  There is a learning curve here.\n\n4.  The handling of MP saves is awesome, but won't allow you to save scum.  You can drop in/out of a multiplayer game with ease, but there is no going back to a previous save.\n\nAll in all, this is a fine game.  AOW has a large following that has been with it for twenty years.  I expected the Goldilocks \"THIS GAME ISN'T X ENOUGH\" brigade to savage it with the reviews, but that has not been the case.  This is an amazing feat in this day and age, and it is due to the expertise and love with which this game was crafted.\n\nWorth full price.\n", "timestamp_created": 1574707632, "timestamp_updated": 1574707632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "57831912": {"recommendationid": "57831912", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978797255", "num_games_owned": 412, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 3545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2474, "last_played": 1575622278}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a warning as much as a review... basically, I'd recommend this game the same way I'd recommend a coke-habit. It's DANGEROUSLY addictive, fully embodying that 'just one more turn' element that the best 4X-games have. Maybe it's just because I've never really gotten into the Age of Wonders games before, while I've been playing Civilization for so long (ever since the very first Civ-game, back on my first PC, 8-bit units and all) that I've gotten desensitized to its appeal?\n\nThen again, there's a lot to pull you in, here, regardless. The way the campaign is laid out is particularly clever, and particularly effective at keeping you engaged. Instead of having to sit through a lengthy campaign with a specific faction, the narrative 'jumps' from faction to faction, with each 'mission' you complete unlocking new ones - and new factions to sample. And the early missions, in particularly, are short and sweet - ending before they have a chance to get stale, and leaving you hungry for more. You may have been sitting there, thinking that you're JUST going to clear this mission and then go to bed... but once you did it, oooh, look! Now you've unlocked the first mission starring the Amazon faction! And while there are two missions for each faction (three for the Vanguard, if you count the brief tutorial), each brings new things to the table. Different Secret Technology, different NPC-factions to fight or absorb, different synergies to explore...\n\nIndeed, the way the research-trees are set up is quite ingenious all by itself, providing excellent replayability. The idea of having  'military' and 'civilian' research-trees running in parallel, saving you from having to pick between growing your armies or your infrastructure, is ingenious - and the way those trees are mixed up is even better. Your 'Military' tree, for starters, has a 'racial' segment at the top that depends on what faction you're playing, letting you research all their units and key gear... and if you absorb another race into your empire, be it through diplomacy or conquest, you get access to their racial tree as well, not only letting you field their units but also equip their gear, potentially creating very intriguing combos. Then there are two 'weapon' trees, or rather LINES, which are also racially dependent - but with a lot of overlap, with each race being able to research the two kinds of weapons they primarily use. And finally, there's the 'Secret Tech' segment, which is the most interesting - picked alongside your faction in character creation, it adds a unique twist and lots of potential synergy to your lineup. Some Race/Tech combinations are obvious, others may prove surprisingly potent despite being a poor fit on the surface. Want your Syndicate to be a bit friendlier? Pick the Celestian Secret Tech, and take your slave-driven crime-empire in a more benevolent direction!\nOn the civilian side, it's mostly always the same, with 'Economic' and 'Operational' tech being identical regardless of who you're playing, and providing you with all the basic tools you need for base-building and espionage. Only the top line gets mixed up, containing stuff unique to both your race AND chosen Secret Tech.\n\nAnd then there's the NPC-factions! Most maps will have several, all will have one, and by doing missions for them you can gradually integrate them into your colony, getting access to THEIR unique units and gear... again creating surprising synergies. The cybernetic Assembly might benefit greatly from allying with the self-aware machines of the Autonomy, granting their own units access to the machine's potent internal networks for army-wide buffs... but the Vanguard could also find some use in fitting the Assembly's potent weapon-mods to their Laser Tanks.\n\nBasically, every mission, every scenario, is a new experience as you combine race, tech, factions and very different environments - from resource-rich but food-poor ice-planets to vast ruined cities that offer swift technological advancement to idyllic garden-planets with lots of food but little else - and the end result is that suddenly it's Monday, and you're not sure what happened to the last couple of days. You have, perhaps, dim memories of grabbing a bag of chips from the cupboard because your stomach was growling and you wanted something you could eat while you play, but surely you must've stopped for a square meal and a nap at SOME point, right?\n\nSo remember, kids, don't do drugs, and don't play AoW: Planetfall unless you have someone around who can pull you out of it and force you to eat, sleep and bathe at regular intervals.", "timestamp_created": 1574701869, "timestamp_updated": 1574701869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "57828344": {"recommendationid": "57828344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027756055", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1596034723}, "language": "english", "review": "If Alpha Centauri and XCOM had a delightful baby...", "timestamp_created": 1574696795, "timestamp_updated": 1574696795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488505750894546509", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "57820543": {"recommendationid": "57820543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033858646", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 258, "last_played": 1583396593}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a multifaceted 4x strategy game that will give you endless options to customize your character, game play and strategy.", "timestamp_created": 1574685174, "timestamp_updated": 1574685174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488505750894546509", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "57810233": {"recommendationid": "57810233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041020327", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 23389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18326, "last_played": 1605259625}, "language": "english", "review": "This game very nearly got a \"no\" from me and I held off reviewing it for quite a while, because I was trying to decide if I wanted to recommend it or not.\n\nLet me give you the short version, first: I am enjoying this game; mostly. But, there are so many problems with it that I know that a lot of people who buy it are going to come away from it disappointed. It is buggy, it has [i]countless[/i] misleading ability/item descriptions that tell you that things should work one way when in fact they work a completely different way, it has awkward animations that always feel stiff and cheap (unfortunately, a trademark of the Age of Wonders franchise), and worst of all... it was developed by a company that is now owned by Paradox, a studio that is [i]infamous[/i] for pushing excessive, overpriced DLCs for half finished games while they completely ignore bugs and broken content for [i]months[/i] or even [i]years[/i] after release. Yet, here I am, with a three digit play time, buying those DLCs the day they come out, so... clearly I can't say that it isn't fun. If you want to know more, read on.\n\nI have been playing Age of Wonders since I was fifteen, and I'm thirty five, now. I have never seen an entry in the series that I haven't liked, and I bought this game as soon as I got the chance. Age 2 advanced the series from Age 1 by [i]a lot[/i], and Age 3 was the best the series has ever been. But this one... it feels a lot like a re-skin of the last one; maybe more like a well made sci-fi mod, than a sequel. If you are old-hat and hoping for another revolutionary leap in the franchise, you won't see it here. Much, if not most, of the content is recycled from Age 3 and while there are many changes, nothing that has been added is actually [i]new[/i]. Maybe some things are new [i] to this series[/i], but they're all things you've seen in other 4X titles, before. You'll recognize things from Endless Legend, especially, and some stuff from Civilization, too, and even a bit from Europa Universalis, to boot, but nothing here is original. Even the sci-fi 4X premise, itself, has already been done to death in the last five years, so you'd better already be a fan of this stuff if you're coming to [u]this[/u] table. \n\nThat being said, I do feel like this game does all of those things much better than they've ever been done before, and presents itself as a very ambitious (if not [i]unpolished[/i]) member of that well-known sci-fi 4X club. If you like the genre then you'll find that this one has quite a lot of content and is fun enough to keep you clicking the 'End Turn' button several thousand times (and pushing on through all of the bugs). The graphics are nice, though not fantastic, and the different races are all interesting and richly developed. They not only have a lot for you to unlock and play with, but they have plenty of lore and identity, too. The Secret techs are cool, the NPC factions are cool, and the unit mod system gives you lots of options for personalizing your units as you build your empire. Playing it all over again, with a new race and tech combo, leads to a very different experience than you had the last time, and that's super important in a game like this.\n\nThe turn based combat is fantastic, and is among the best I have ever seen in a 4X title. Psychic soldiers who infect the enemy's mind with evil spirits, causing them to explode and release ghosts onto the battlefield, dinosaur-riding amazons shooting laser arrows, bugs that eat you and poop out giant maggots, deathbots that fire plasma cannons that light the battlefield on fire; it's all great. But then, Age has always had great combat. It might stand out when you compare it to everything else you've seen on Steam, but it isn't much better than what we got in the last game, and to be perfectly frank, I much preferred the high-fantasy aesthetic to the sci-fi aesthetic. Dragons, spells, undead; that was more my jam, than aliens and laserguns. I miss the wizards, a lot. \n\nPlus, the combat experience, while great overall, is persistently hindered by ability/item descriptions that mislead you as to how they work. You'll go and use an ability that says it causes your unit to turn rabid, and attack the nearest [i][b]enemy[/b][/i] with bonus damage, only to find out they'll attack anyone nearby and you wind up killing your own dude. You'll activate a power because it says your Xeno creatures are immune to it, and it'll turn out theyre not. You'll target a machine with an attack that says it works on machines, only to find out it doesn't affect [i]that[/i] machine, for some reason. You'll try to equip a mod that turns all of your psychic attacks into poisonous fire, but for whatever reason the game will tell you that the unit in question has no psychic attacks, even if he has three...\n\nThe game [i]could[/i] be awesome, but it's broken in so many ways and it just feels more like an awkward spinoff than a proper sequel. And, because it's owned by Paradox, now, the devs are hard at work on their upcoming DLCs instead of fixing anything, and I am left to wonder if that means its problems will ever see real attention paid to them. Many of these issues have existed since launch, and their updates contain a nominal offering of remedies, at best. \n\nSo... overall... this game is fun, but the acquisition by Paradox has seriously tarnished it and holds it back. If you're really into 4X games, you'll like it, especially if you're into the sci-fi aesthetic. If you've played all of the Age games, before now, you'll think it's \"ok\", and have some fun. But... if you're new to the franchise, and you want to try it out, just go and get Age of Wonders 3. It was leaps and bounds ahead of this thing in quality, had more content, and was a lot more stable. It remains the paragon of the series, while this will probably fall off the radar in another year or two.", "timestamp_created": 1574662455, "timestamp_updated": 1574663449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 117, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865920543670654297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "57809426": {"recommendationid": "57809426", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993380223", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 23503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15124, "last_played": 1607134253}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the better 4x games I've played in awhile.

Simultaneous-turns multiplayer would be great but has a big flaw.\n\nSingle player perfectly scratches the large 4X strategy itch! The city management is similar enough to existing games to be understandable, but the districts system is also unique and refreshing. The tactical combat is incredibly complex and detailed. There are some tweaks I would make --- simplify tactical combat a bit because it's got more moving parts than it needs to be interesting, add some stronger incentives against ICS, etc --- but overall they are quite minor and I really enjoyed it.\n\nSimultaneous-turns multiplayer has a major technical flaw that when one player engages in a tactical battle, no other player can take any actions, causing huge amounts of down time. And the tactical combats are long. We've been playing on \"Always Auto-combat\" mode to remedy this, but this means we're missing out on a huge part of what the game has to offer. This sadly means my group will move on to other options for our 4X multiplayer game. We've had some luck in 2-player humans vs AI games, where we at least let each person watch the other's combats, but even that gets tedious fast.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1573322245, "timestamp_updated": 1573322245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "56847384": {"recommendationid": "56847384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023618634", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7698, "last_played": 1601832377}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game.", "timestamp_created": 1573312499, "timestamp_updated": 1573312499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "56813235": {"recommendationid": "56813235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031574214", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 16433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1788, "last_played": 1610386462}, "language": "english", "review": "AoW; Planetfall is both a welcome improvement on Age of Wonders 3, and a great 4X on its own merit", "timestamp_created": 1573279688, "timestamp_updated": 1573279688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "56807810": {"recommendationid": "56807810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027284876", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 9155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2388, "last_played": 1610124937}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome game.

game is now, I do not recommend it.\n\nI played the entire series extensively, over 4.000 hours over all titles of the series, for me personally, they changed things that were good about the game, and kept things that were bad about it.\n\nCity Siege\nThe first thing that is really noticeable and changes the dynamic of sieges entirely, they removed gates from city walls, those were replaced by militias and defensive towers, however these militias don't have mods, and you can't aim the towers, so any other troop that attacks the city will be stronger.\n\nThe amount of terrain attackers have to move was also reduced, and there are no longer heavy ranged units ( like ballistas from previous games ) available universally, on top of that, there are a ton of barricades on every single city fight for the attackers (???) not only buildings, but lower barricades themselves that have no purpose other than provide cover for the attackers, these covers for the attackers have the exact same defensive capabilities as the ones available for the defenders, so basically makeshift barricades have the same defensive value as solid concrete defenses from walls, so attackers are on equal grounds, not on the disadvantage from terrain you would expect when facing a army that would be waiting and ready for a siege.\n\nDefensive units also do not gain a bonus for high ground anymore, so any player that properly understand show to use terrain for their advantage will have a advantage, and since ranged attacks had their ranged lowered, \n\nCities\nThe cities themselves changed a lot on some aspects, buildings do not need money to be build anymore, only units, and you need to have dedicated units around your cities to keep claiming terrain to expand your cities.\nThe effectiveness of the kind of expansion, Industry, Energy (gold), research or food, depends on the terrain of the expansion, but there are mixed variations of terrain, and how effective the expansion is depends on both kinds of terrains, this adds a interesting dynamic to the city management, but why a space faring civilization of galaxy wide capabilities is unable to terraform terrain to the kind you need is beyond me, so you are restricted by what the game offers and based on luck of generated terrain, your opponents can get several 'good' terrains for their play style while you get 'bad' ones, but unlike previous titles that also had this issue, but this would only be a 'problem' early on, now these affect the city production much more, so a city that manages to have two good production expansions can pop units much faster than any other city, or a city with two good energy expansions can provide a ton of extra energy, I've seen differences of almost 400% between one city output and the other, again, this is only a problem o the end-game, but enough of a problem to be game breaking.\n\nMonument raid\nThere are some sort of structures that provide much higher production once exploited by a city expansion than normal terrains, adding extra population slots and considerably more production of something, like industry or research, but those are either defended by marauders, or you need to deal with a minor faction through either diplomacy or conquest.\nHowever, unlike cities, these monuments can only be attacked by a army of 6 units, because... well, there is no explanation on why...., it just is, giving the feel that, instead of having to put effort on making the computer play better, they instead limited the amount of units a player can use, as a form of clutch, and this specific aspect I find very frustrating\n\nOperations\nThey equivalent of magic from previous iterations is called operations, there are three kinds, to use in combat, to use in the world map as a instant operation, or to use as a empire wide bonus, but now you no longer have to worry with the range of operations, they can be 'cast' anywhere, \n\nLike previous iterations, there are still borderline useless operations that I have never, ever used because other options are simple better, or simply because what they do is meaningless, like native threat detector, or Call of the Hive, or Sway Ideology, the point isn't that what some of those operations do isn't in some way useful, it's that either their cost, or the amount of research needed to unlock them is so high, that by the time you have them, due to the limited amount of operations you can perform, you don't use those, ever, because there are considerably better alternatives, or better usage for their cost in energy or influence.\n\nBut then again, that has always been a problem on the franchise, I feel like it's like having a soldier who owns the best dagger in the world, but he never uses it because he rides a dragon into battle, so having the option to use the dagger is pointless.\n\nHeroes\nHeroes have, once again, been nerfed, and I feel that most of their skills are too similar, depending on the level cap of the map you can level your heroes to be support of the army, or slight more effective in combat, but not enough to be able to fight on their own a T4 unit, or even most T3 units, this again changes the dynamic of the game, but I personally did not like this change, I miss both they being stronger and also having more customization options, on the other hand, they don't have a upkeep cost anymore, but I didn't find this buff to be necessary, and to be honest, don't understand the reasoning for they not having a upkeep.\n\nTroops\nThere is a new mechanic introduced called staggering, to reduce the amount of action points a unit has based on how strong a skill impacts them, there is a counter for that, being stagger resistance or immunity.\n\nI enjoy this a lot, felt like a awesome change, adding several different usages and also things to consider when thinking on the moves of your units.\n\nHowever, I also feel that just one significant additional mechanic alone is not enough, it's great, it's welcome, and also, it is not enough, specially for a futuristic world.\n\nA.I., Combat and Terrain\nGame A.I. has improved a bit, it is still one of the best for games of the genre, but still feels like it has room for improvement, sometimes they don't use terrain properly, and there is a hidden issue on that, regarding the terrain.\n\nThere are terrain stuff, like rocks or debris, that can be used for cover EVERYWHERE, I mentioned this during my point regarding city siege, like, when you fight on a road, there are always a ton of car and truck debris, sometimes it feels like you're fighting on the super bowl parking lot\n\nAnd that happens everywhere, fight on a city? no worries, attackers not only have buildings for cover, they have entire LAYERS of buildings for cover! \n\nThe feeling I have is that they wanted to make the cover mechanic more widespread, but that is absurdly exaggerated on this iteration of the franchise, also, some of those covers don't make sense, like a hover bike or tank hiding behind a tree, some units seem to not be classified correctly for their scale, or the system itself needs rework.\n\nAnd so far I have not mentioned a single bug in the game, I myself had to deal with several, like units stuck in their movement animation endlessly, making their turn in combat last forever, or operations not working properly, like the cryogenic sleep awakening operation giving less population to a city than the operation lists, or having to wait a turn once the city reaches maximum number of colonist to configure it to send food to other colonies otherwise one of your colonists dies, and those are the ones I remember at the top of my head while writing this review, and those are kinda minor bugs, I experienced several complete freezes that forced me to restart the game entirely.\n\nThe game, as it is now, is kinda nice, but needs work, has a ton of space for improvement, and before I can recommend it, it needs at least a major work effort to fix the current bugs the game has.\n\nUpdate: review of the expansion on comments.", "timestamp_created": 1573106938, "timestamp_updated": 1575717618, "voted_up": false,

"english", "review": "For some time now, there has been a tendency in strategy games to have a haptic, visual and cognitive overload with details, functions, missions and the like.\n\n\"Planetfall\" is a terribly deterrent example of this tendency:\n\nIn the very first part of the campaign after the tutorial (\"Leave-6\"), the player is overwhelmed with so many missions - including missions that follow contradictory strands of action - that he soon loses the overview completely and - inevitably - falls into an orgy of clicks that only annoys after a few hours of playing time.\n\nIn addition, the stories behind the missions are terribly infantile. Who comes up with such pubertal stuff?", "timestamp_created": 1572994326, "timestamp_updated": 1572994500, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484961122274398804", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "56570177": {"recommendationid": "56570177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038104125", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 10959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10959, "last_played": 1572915397}, "language": "english", "review": "Age of Wonders: Planetfall is probably best described as a blend of the Civilization, Total War, and XCOM series.\n\nThe game includes a good tutorial and gives you an idea of how the rest of it is going to play. While it should be accessible to anyone interested in a strategy game, Age of Wonders has a rather unique way of playing.\n\nAs far as the campaign goes, each race (of which there are 6) has two relatively long missions, with hero progress and choices carrying over to the next mission. The decisions you make have an effect on some later missions, particularly the last mission, but there is no wrong way to win. The story is honestly a bit bland.\n\nLike many 4X games, battle is absolutely necessary and cannot be avoided. It frees up occupied tiles, awards resources and hero items, and grants your troops experience. You field army stacks of no more than 6 units, typically led by a hero. These stacks can reinforce each other in battle. At the beginning, you explore from your starting position, coming into conflict with neutral forces that occupy your expansion paths. Eventually you encounter other players and may engage them in diplomacy or war.\n\nThere are only 3 major resources in the game: food, energy, and \"cosmite\". The latter two are used to create and maintain combat units, with \"cosmite\" being required to build more advanced troops or augment existing troops to perform better in combat. This means lower tier units can still serve a role (and indeed may be necessary) in late-game compositions.\n\nResearch and city-building has parallels to Civilization but is more narrow. It is focused on producing stronger combat units or providing better support. Expanding revolves around building colonizers, not unlike Civilization's settlers, which can found new cities. Unlike other similar games, players in Planetfall must \"annex\" territories next to settled cities to grow their borders.\n\nIn terms of factions, there are 6 player factions and 5 \"NPC\" factions. In Planetfall, \"NPC\" factions are distinct from other neutral units and are a bit like city-states in Civilization, which provide quests and unique units. Each player faction can be further customized with a set of perks/flaws and a so-called \"secret technology\", which unlock different units and operations.\n\nBalance-wise, I think Planetfall manages to make every race and secret technology not feel underpowered, although I definitely think some are a little stronger than others. There is good variety on unit compositions, but many units are also similar to each other and you quickly realize what type of combos you like.\n\nThe game has its share of bugs and quality-of-life issues. There are annoyances to be had with end of turn notifications relating to unit movement, particularly if you reload a save where you intentionally skipped a unit's turn.\n\nOverall, I think Age of Wonders: Planetfall is a fun game with its own sets of challenges. Its unique playstyle is not for everyone, but if you enjoy Civilization, Total War, and XCOM, it is worth giving this game a shot. If you also just enjoy 4X games with a focus on combat, this may be a good fit.", "timestamp_created": 1572971976, "timestamp_updated": 1572972089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649158596992492676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "56522996": {"recommendationid": "56522996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140852580", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 4306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4062, "last_played": 1617337898}, "language": "english", "review": "ngl its pretty good", "timestamp_created": 1572912846, "timestamp_updated": 1572912846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "56508439": {"recommendationid": "56508439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050028428", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2017, "last_played": 1606541404}, "language": "english", "review": "Great and well-polished 4X strategy game, with the same great tactical battles as the previous entries in this series.

A lot of mechanics, units and skills to learn. Quality is not prime, but well worth the time if you are into Scifi and 4X\n\nThe Scifi realm is nice to have for a change instead of the historical times over and over. The overworld works nicely with lots of different things to explore, many items, buildings and unit types and combination of upgradeability. It takes A LOT of time to learn all the mechanics in the game and how they intertwine and affect each other. Even after completing the campaign, there are some features which I do not fully grasp how they work.\n\n\nThe tactical combat is interesting - yet at some point it does get boring and nullified and kind of \"waste of time\".. \nThere are so many skills and co-operating units to take into consideration that I noticed it is just better to allow the auto-combat to do its trick instead of trying to micro manage everything and trying to remember what unit has what.. And there's a lot of combat. In the last three missions I did not use manual tactical combat a single time, but the strategic gameplay was still enjoyable. It would be nice to play manually the meaningful battles, but those are usually so massive, with tens and tens of units on the battlefield that it gets even more difficult to manage. Knowing how the tactical combat works, gets you means to do strategic decisions and that's how I preferred to enjoy my end-game.\n\nCouple bugs I encountered: \n - The silly AI, sometimes doing silly decisions or not attacking when it should\n - After winning a map, the \"Continue campaign\" button would not do anything. Would have to load latest save and pass couple turns, then win the game again and it would work.\n\nAnnoyances:\n - Endgame strategic view gets so cluttered and annoying to pass turns, as other factions move units one at a time its so difficult to follow what is moving and where where (using the fast mode only, slow mode is unusable due to wasted time in animations)\n\nRequests:\n - Ability to set per faction to be seen after passing a turn when they move.

This is a wargame, not a civlike. It contains civlike mechanics, but if you attempt to play the game passively, building up your empire and economy, you're going to find yourself quickly falling behind, running out of resources, and losing. This is a game about building big armies you use to invade and take land and resources, then turn those resources into more armies, more land, and more resources. City building is far more simple and straightforward than Civ, and can easily feel like there's nothing to do if you're not building armies because city upgrades come far slower than your building of units.\n\nUnits can have long, detailed statblocks with a long list of benefits, and can then be customized to do all manner of things. A basic soldier wielding an electrical rifle in the early game can quickly become a unit who wields a chain lightning stun rifle that ignores cover. A soldier with a plasma launcher can equip themselves with a medical kit and the means to heal and empower themselves from the flames they create and form a rolling barrage of fire that incinerates anything that dares to approach them. These are not expensive lategame units, these are basic cannon fodder.

The switch to space/future stuff is maybe an issue for me, but I think the real issue is t he map.  Way to busy and hard to see what is going on.  I know the devs wanted to bring a very intense map to the game, but they have over thought and over engineered it IMO.  Age of Wonder III is amazing on it's map display and UI.  If it's not broken why try and fix it.  I've been a developer (now SRE) for all my life and I wish the next Age of Wonders would go back to what made this game great.  \n\nSo my advice to customers is, if you don't already own it, buy Age of Wonders III first.  IMO, it's a much more fun game with incredible variety and detail with the easy of a fantastic UI.  A rare combination in games these days.  Also it's a very mature game in versions (bug fixes, feature improvements, DLCs, etc.).  So buy and play Age of Wonders III first then if you still have some spare cash to throw at another game in the series, go for Planetfall.  Maybe you will enjoy it more than me.

Sounds neat right? \n\nYou can even equip your heroes and units however you like. Is that a plus? I'm sure someone thinks it is anyway.\n\nUnfortunate reality is that it is dead boring. \n\nMy gut reaction to this game is that the biggest problem is the crummy Civ clone strategic layer which suffocates the interesting stuff under a layer of dead boring decisions about whether your people really need a toilet or a kitchen in this city. If all of that cruft were cut away and replaced with pure tactical battle scenarios it'd be a much more interesting experience. \n\nOn to more specific complaints :\n\nThe main enemy armies gallivant around the map without a care in the world so you can easily surprise them with a wardec and annex a good portion of their country before they return home. \n\nThe tactical combat has a lot of dead time. Instead of allowing the two sides to deploy basically in contact you spend the first few turns slowly moving to contact and then the fight happens. \n\nYou can in theory buy lots of neat upgrades for your units and your heroes. In practice you will find that it is hard to scrape up enough special resources for something like that because of the civ layer. \n\nThere is water combat. I wish there wasn't but there is. It is really bad and it shouldn't exist. The designers clearly focused most of their effort on the land portion and have left a stub naval game.

There's individual army unit customization similar to Endless Legend with unit type loadouts, except the items have very distinct effects (instead of \"increase attack by 10%\"). \n\nThe overworld portion has also had an overhaul.

Now, players still have that territory around the city, but will expand by taking control of nearby regions.

The factions all have very distinct and unique unit rosters which leads to interesting and varied gameplay. In combination this creates one of the most engaging tactical combat systems out there.\n\nAlthough the main focus of the game is still combat as it has always been the economic side has seen an overhaul too in the form of a sector system.

Similarity to Endless Legends is a bit too obvious, but welcome - as far as strategic layers go, EL is imho the uncontested king, so why not learn from the very best?\n\nCombat is just as fun as it was before, adding possibility of grazing is an excellent idea. Battles are fun, interesting and complex. The developers admit big inspiration by XCOM, which is great. Once again - why not learn from the best?\n\nProper research tree that sets just the right pacing. Whenever you research something, it feels like you benefit from it right away and it stays for a while. This is pretty nice compared to e.g. main Civilization titles, where research speed often eclipsed production speed, i.e. you never could build everything you wanted or even half the things you wanted (Beyond Earth did this better).\n\nProduction times are also reasonably paced, i.e. you can field an army quite quickly, but you need resources to support its maintenance. This also means losing a few units when creeping isn't a game over for you (unlike in HOMAM).\n\nThe developers keep working on the game. I recommend checking out their developer diaries, it makes for an interesting read.\n\nFactions are well graphically designed and have interesting backstories, I've spent a lot of time by just reading the descriptions.\n\nThe game runs perfectly smoothly even on a laptop optimized for programming (low-end graphics card) - one of the few AA titles I can actually run on my machine.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\nThe game takes some time to grow onto you - it might feel too clustered and too overcomplicated at first. You need to invest some time to get to like it and enjoy it, which might in today's age of DOTA and Fortnite be an issue for some people.\n\nEven though they look very different, the factions essentially play the same with just minor differences. It feels very close to Age of Empires 2, where the civs differed by a unique unit, few advantages and lack of some specific units - here e.g. the Amazons don't have a sniper unit, but instead they get a knight-like unit. Ultimately the playstyle is the same for all factions. With scifi settings it feels like the factions could be far more diverse - see Starcraft or Endless Space for amazing examples of this.\n\n[i]Minor spoiler alert[/i]\nThe campaign is very weak. I know this particular issue has been troubling AoW3 as well, but here it kinda hits in the face. The campaign consists of thirteen missions (not including tutorial) - two missions for each faction and one final mission to wrap it up. The story is told in a very lackluster way, even though it could have some potential, but that's not the biggest problem. It's the individual missions - they all feel and play exactly the same. Ok, sometimes you have an island map, sometimes the map is filled with teleporters, sometimes you play on a map that is 90% volcanic, but that's not really enough. The only two missions that felt really diverse were when the climate of the whole map kept regularly switching and when you started the map with all covert operations already researched. And even there you were tasked with just building up your empire and armies and conquering either some opponents or some key structures. Heck, even the first Warcraft all those 30 years ago had better mission design.\n\n[b]Verdict:[/b]\nIt is obvious that the negative points are by far outweighted by the plus ones. Planetfall takes the best of Age of Wonders, XCOM and Endless Legends and creates a mix that is the best turn-based strategy we've seen in the last few years.

This recommendation, however, comes with a VERY important caveat - when you are making a scenario play the game on the 'fastest' setting, and reduce the amount of dwellings to the minimal value.\n\nThese recommendations are meant to address my two biggest beefs with the game in that it starts to feel held up by diplomacy mechanics and researching new technologies and building more structures. \n\nIf you read this far, I want to give some more details about the things this game does well and poorly\n\nThe good:\n - The atmosphere in terms of music, lore, and environment, and characters makes the Sci-Fi universe of the game and motives of the various races extremely compelling.\n - The tech-tree revisions between the fantasy AoW and Planetfall (random spells in a spell book versus progressive tech trees split into purely economic and purely military growth, respectively) make tech progression much more satisfying. Furthermore, changing out specializations (with little internal synergy or impactful gameplay) to be less numerous but much more in depth in the form of Secret Technologies make your choice more important.\n - The mod systems (up to 3 mods per unit) allows you upgrade your units in unique ways and create more interesting unit compositions than in previous titles. Another benefit of Secret Technologies is that you get access to more mods - increasing the depth of unit build once again.\n\nIn summary, reduced complexity in some areas and increased complexity in others makes the game easier to grasp more quickly. More importantly, it is a game that is more difficult to achieve mastery in because of this same set of changes.\n\nWhile the problems in the game are less numerous than the advantages, they may be deal breakers for some and is the reason for my earlier recommendations (Increased game speed and minimal dwellings). \n\nThe bad:\n - The game plays very slowly and the sector system, while it definitely has its advantages, means you have to wait for colonists and food growth to grow your bases. This is largely solved by the increased game speed, but doesn't address the next issue...\n- Diplomacy moves extremely slowly, and dwellings are extremely demanding yet also rewarding to invest into. With the standard amount of dwellings this grinds the game to a halt since the threat of engaging them is too dangerous in the early game. This issue is solved well by reducing the amount of dwellings, since that increases competition for exclusive access to them - encouraging you to compete and, eventually, go to war with your enemies. \n\nThere are numerous other small changes that are big deals to me as well (militia garrisons, fewer OP unit buffing structures, and better melee/ranged diversity to name a few), I hope you give AoW: Planetfall a try.", "timestamp_created": 1570588651, "timestamp_updated": 1570588678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501295328140258789", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "55518021": {"recommendationid": "55518021", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981854007", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1653, "last_played": 1565926775}, "language": "english", "review": "Small scale tactical combat is a cool idea but gets boring really quickly.

It is a nice change and their artists/designers/scenarits got a really nice vibe/setting.\n- The factions (6) are very distinctive and fun to play. They look different and play different. Definitely not a civ where you have 2 different units tops per faction. Every single unit in a faction is different, a specific branch of research is also specific to faction.\n- The secret techs (6), which you can combine with the factions (36 combinations then) are also great. Have their specifc branch of research as well.\n- I absolutely adore that some of the secret tech specifc units do look sometimes different and have some different perks. This is a return of a nice feature of AoW3, I really thank devs and artists for not dropping this. I will give an example: Promothean has a  unit called purifiers. With vanguards, they will have plasma guns, amazons, plasma bows... And this level of detail in a game for me is always greatly appreciated! It really helps to feel playing a different faction.\n- UI feels very natural to me.\n\nThe game itself does not differ much from the Age of Wonders 3 formula, so if you disliked AoW3 (how dare you?), chances are that you won't like Planetfall all that much.\nWhat differences are there:\n- Unit mods! You could get some buffs to units in Ao3, you still can in planetfall, but on top of that, you can equip units with mods that will modify their skills/dmg/defense/aoe, which allow a huge number of different strategies. This is probably the feature to single out in all the new things. It might be comparable to Endless Legend, but this is here 10 times more satisfactory as you can direct your units and therefore craft more subtle strategies (for example, you can mod 1 single specific unit as defensive, and the same unit modded as offensive and use them differently on battlefield).\n- No underground plane (like in AoW3). Some people see it as a setback, I personnally do like it as it makes the pace of the game faster\n- The campaign is now made of scenarios which are scripted missions on a random map. Outcome can be different (but I didn't test that out fully tbh). Some people dislike it, I personnally have finished the campaign and that must be a first in 20 years that I actually play scenarized maps/campaign in a 4X. It did work for me because some maps I felt I could not reach the end. In another game, that's the moment I get disheartened and drop the campaign because I don't feel restarting a map that I know. Here I was ok to restart because at least the map would be different and fresh enough.\n- The city battles (a bit like AoW3) are not of a chore to me (it felt a bit so to me in AoW3). This might be because sci-fi setting offers more ranged units? In any case, to me this is a good thing.\n- Tier 1/2 units are more relevant.\n\nSo, I'm really glad I bought this game and have no single instant of remorse on my purchase because there is a lot of contents and a lot of replayability (and I didn't even play multiplayer so far). You really feel the love of the team for their game!\n\nCan I mention things I dislike. Actually not really, I really do think this game surpassed my expectations which were quite high from Ao3.\n- I still think the game will be made better by expansions (look at Ao3 how it became just absolutely fantastic to the point I would be saying it replaced Master of Magic in my heart. Ok ex-aequo ^^)\n- Ok, I miss the fully random commander from AoW3 (in a patch some day pretty please, like you did for AoW3 :-) ?)\n- I feel the water part of the game is not as satisfactory as the rest, maybe a balance issue to make the boats less expensive?\n\nOverall, the design of the game is really sound. Everything feels logical, and it is very polished once again.\n\nJust look  at my playtime...\n\nObviously a big positivereview and I recommend it to all 4x afficionados.

If you don't do things perfectly right from the beginning, or have a bad starting point, then you'll start to fall behind and never really be able to catch up with your opponents. This is further amplified by the extreme amount of \"cat and mouse\" that takes place in the strategic map. Usually you'll end up just posturing your armies trying to gauge your opponents strength, and ensuring that you can win a overwhelming victory before finally entering into combat. If instead you suffer a major loss to your force, the game is essentially over for you at that point, because the amount of time it takes to rebuild all of your units is immense, and by that time your opponent will have claimed or destroyed all your cities.\n\nThe tactical game play is also extremely confusing. The UI and overly clustered tactical maps make it extremely difficult to apply any sort of strategy when moving your units. It will be very difficult to know if you moving to close to the enemy or if your going to be too far. Usually I just let the computer auto play at this point because it seems to have a better sense of just how far to move units than the UI will ever give me.\n\nFinally, as was present in Age of Wonders 3, multiplayer was never fixed. You still have to wait as an opponent plays a tactical engagement before you are allowed to do anything else. Throughout the life of Age of Wonders 3 there were so many suggestions on how this could be redesigned to allow players to truely play simultaneously, but its seems all of those suggestions were ignored, making multiplayer a game of spending most of your time at the PC doing nothing while waiting for another player to finish their turn or battle.", "timestamp_created": 1569692867, "timestamp_updated": 1569692867, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492642343044281006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "55317143": {"recommendationid": "55317143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044377435", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 8928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1804, "last_played": 1614604581}, "language": "english", "review": "Most boring campaign ever.\n\nI wish they just make Wizards throne again with better graphics instead.", "timestamp_created": 1569671424, "timestamp_updated": 1569671424, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518861293792724609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "55313684": {"recommendationid": "55313684", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993193233", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 924, "last_played": 1568489735}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't help but to give my penny to the negative reviews jar.

As someone who has enjoyed all the past AoW games, I had high hopes for this game - especially as it seemed to promise deeper 4x gameplay at the strategic level. There are some good things in here (combat is a highlight like past AoW games) but so much else is a mess. The UI is horrible to use and the overall design and presentation is so visually dense that it is often a pain figuring out what you're looking at on the map and UI. This all comes together to make the mechanics far more difficult to figure out and track than they should be. This lack of elegance and clarity in the design too often makes it feel like work to play the game. It feels like the design team bit off more than they could handle in adding some of the new strategic layers and couldn't translate that design into a usable and fun experience.\n\nUPDATE: Tried this game again almost a year after this review, hoping things have improved. Ugh. Maybe improvements exist in the DLCs but the base game is still as uninspired as I remember it.\n\nWhile combat remains pretty good, other Xs in this game are just underwhelming. What should I explore and exploit in this game? Other than Cosmite, regions offer so little reward or interest it doesn't seem to make much difference what I annex. Research - to me - remains pretty unrewarding as well with many techs offering small, incremental effects that don't have much affect on the arc of your game. There rarely seems to be any sense of accomplishing something meaningful in the game.\n\nIf you want to play this mainly for the combat - with some other systems tacked on - then I think a player could enjoy this (though I'd point players to Gladius - which is a tighter and better game imo).

It feels fresh, thought-out, and innovative in many points and does many things better than it's 4X competitors. If you think the fights in civilization were boring you get with Planetfall a 4X game in which you are 80% of the time on combat map and 20% of time on strategic map. \n\nThe combat system feels like XCOM2 but it's distinguishable in many ways. You can equip your army with miscellaneous modifications and skills. Heroes leed your armies and can be leveled and equipped too. You find many items and buffs in camps on strategic map which is a nice rng element - every match will be a new due to the high variety in ingame lore and map creation. War with npc factions or buying them with influence? Take their dwelling or get units, operations or modificatrions from them? These elements are giving the game a high play again worth. And like in Civ or other games: it's always nice to start a new game, to find new places for new colonies and to observe the progress.\n\n[h1]Factions and Secret Technologies[/h1]\n\nPlanetfall has so far 4 factions but new are already announced in the upcoming dlcs. Nevertheless the 4 factions are already enough and they are played completly different. You want a balanced and broad humanoid army, pick vanguard. You like a defensive faction which can create or destroy mountains on map - pick DVAR. Assembly is a cyborg race with vorpal snipers and much electronic stuff. Kirko is an insectoid race with poison spells and swarm shields which give your units protection when they stick together.\n\nBut how a race is played depends on the Secret Technology you pick. They are so far 6 secret technologies which leeds to many combination possibilities (basic race units + modifications + items + npc stuff + buffs from landmarks) and all are played totally different. The DLCs will bring in new factions and secret techs aswell. \n\nIf you want to see how different a race can played, watch this Kirko guide by Pappus on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-loV9rhWU8\n\n[h1]Negative reviews on Steam[/h1]\n\nI don't get the point in the negative reviews in steam so far, which are mostly written by players with less game hours. The UI is catchable and the gameplay can not bore so fast due to the high amount of combination possibilities. Maybe these players are better placed in fast-incentivized games like Fortnite.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\nIf you can identify yourself with the first abstract it is a clear buy. If you don't like flat learning curves and you don't want to read the many textes in the ingame encyclopedia - do not buy.\n\nThe success of this game will depend on the balancing of all ingame mechanics, especially in multiplayer. There is a nice lobbysystem and matches can played simultaniously or turn after turn, turns can saved during the turn aswell. But is Triumph able to balance all factions and the new secret techs that are announced?

BUT I've got my fair share in many other 4X titles. AOW : Planetfall is just amazing.\nThe graphics are okayish. Could be better, could be worse. When looking at games like \"Endless Legend\" that are more than four or five years old however AOW seems kinda...well...not that pretty. But in the 4X genre graphics aren't everything and in nearly every other aspect AOW shines.\n\nThe factions, world generation, world quests, AI and the tactical combat are really really good. Especialy the combat. Take some XCOM and throw it in a CIV game and you can imagine what the combat is about. It's also kinda important to mention that during COOP (yeah the game has multiplayer!) you can have some pretty epic threeway battles! That does sound exactly as \"insert-profane-word-here\" as it is...in a good way. Also you can customize your commander AND your units in a XCOMish kinda way. Well I wish I could adjust the look of the default unittypes even more but then again, space dwarves with flamethrowers riding on giant lizards infected with a xeno plague parasite, seems to be alright too.\n\nThere's quite some diversity in factions and tech and the combinations of them. Amazon's riding on dinosaurs, throwing around cyber deamons? Check. Maybe giving them some nasty psi powers and melt their enemies brains? Check. Or going full scale insect race with flamethrowers, buy some borderlands(tm) psycho units from a minor faction and throw an army of insect warriors with flamethrowers, riding mad max style trucks into battle, on your enemy? Check, too. So yeah there's quite a lot to do and every race/combination plays differently too.\n\nTalking bout multiplayer, that is where many 4X games get really boring (looking again at you here Endless Legend). AOW:P however manages to deliver multiplayer without it being boring for whatever reason. I can't point my finger on it. Maybe it's because the rounds don't take that much time (like in CIV where you could go watch a TV show while your fellow players do their turn). Maybe it's because the win conditions make for some really nice scenarios. Like when you have to break the alliance with your coop buddy because he dared to go for the armageddon victory and you can't support that (looking at you my beloved wife... she really won that one...). Multiplayer is where the game takes up on the pace and feels really really good.\n\nI for one can only hope that there will be some nice addons/DLCs in the future with even more races and tech combinations to try out.

It was the first fantasy 4X game I had played that felt as good as the Heroes of Might an Magic games of old. Mainly Heroes 3 with a bit of Heroes 4 which were my favorites. That great blend of Hero characters that level up exploring the map to clear mobs, and get loot. Along with fast paced empire building, and war with turn based tactical battles. Then they stopped making DLC for it, and there was nothing. Until now with Planetfall. And though they may have switched it over to a Science Fiction style the great core gameplay is still there. In fact it's pretty much improved on in all areas.\n\nIt would take too long to write out the improvements or changes. Instead i'll just say if you liked AOW3 you will probably love this. If you like 4X games with more of a focus on the expansion/warfare elements you will also probably enjoy it. The only real negative thing I have to say about Planetfall is that the Campaign is lackluster. They switched from hand crafted maps to random maps. So the more challenging RPG feel of AOW3 is lost, and replaced mostly with what feels like Skirmish maps with extra objectives, and scripted alliances.\n\nOverall though the game is great, and in my opinion a leader in the genre. I don't even think other big players like the Civ series have as many options for things like play by email multiplayer.

Then here's my TL;DR: Game is awesome, BUY.\n\nWhat makes it awesome though? To cover this, I've divided this review into 4 parts that I find important in a 4X: Gameplay systems, replayability, art and expression.\n\n[h1]Gameplay systems[/h1]\nThe most significant part of a 4X and the one that keeps you going for one more turn until the wee hours of the morning. AoW: Planetfall consists of 2 parts: A Civilizations-like strategic layer and an XCom-like tactical layer.\n\n[b]Strategic[/b]\nOn the strategic layer you build your colonies, perform diplomacy, do quests, research, create and mod armies and kit out your heroes. It is a bit of a cross between Civilization and Endless Legend, although it of course bears the closest resemblence to AoW3.\nThe thing that defines this part most is choices, choices, choices. From army composition to reasearch to which faction to ally with to expansion to balancing the resources; You are always making difficult choices based on the situation at hand. These choices also always bring rewards in one form or another, giving the player that sweet shot of dopamine.\n\n[b]Tactical[/b]\nThe one thing AoW always does better than its contemporaries in the 4X genre is combat and Planetfall is no exception. The shift of focus from melee to ranged brings XCOM-style cover systems into the mix and it is a great match for the flanking mechanics that AoW3 already brought to the table. The thing that makes tactical combat stand out to me is the incredible array of options and units that you can have at your disposal; From standard troopers with their assault rifles and grenades to giant plants that serve as biochemical artillery and mechanical monstrosities that can simply wade through walls and bash people on the head with a giant hammer. There is a lot of variety in the game's roster and this spices the game's battles up and makes you giddy to try and use that new unit or mod that you've researched or received as a quest reward.\n\n[h1]Replayability[/h1]\n4X games tend to take a long time to finish per playthrough and if a game is finally finished, there needs to be an insentive to do it all over again. To pour another 20 hours into a match from start to finish. Planetfall covers this nicely by offering an extensive random scenario generator and allowing the player to combine any of the 6 races with the 6 different secret technologies. These two factors more than enough variety to keep you going for hours on end.\n\n[h1]Art[/h1]\nGenerally what lures me into a game is its art style: Do I like the characters? The colours? The world setting? If I spend hundreds of hours in a universe, it needs to be an interesting one. In my opinion the unitverse of Planetfall IS an enteresting place to be. The 6 factions breathe character while leaving enough space to fill in the gaps yourself and play the race as you want to play it. The neutral factions are created with the same love and attention as the playable factions and all units in the game, from the lowly scout drone to the mighty Arborian Queen, express themselves through their form, their abilities, their sounds and their animations. A special shout-out goes to the music, which strikes a nice balance between futuristic and classic AoW and I found myself whistling along to it quite quickly.\n\n[h1]Expression[/h1]\nI want to be able to express myself in a 4X: Play the way I want to, while leading MY faction to shape the setting the way I see fit. It is supposed to be the story of me. Planetfall has plenty of customization options; Not just in the selection of race and secret technology, but also in the customization of your commander, the setting up of the world, research selection, different victory goals to follow, a morality and public support system and the way the AI and neutral factions respond to your actions. The game always makes me feel that it flows a certain way due to my decisions and that gives me the agency I want from a game like this.\n\n[h1]Additional comments[/h1]\nA few more things I like to add:\n[list]\n[*]AI is hard to get right in a 4X and I think it is decent, both in strategic as well as tactical modes. I feel the game gives me enough of a challenge to keep me on my toes and if I feel like I'm getting too good, I simply set up a team game or give more bonuses to the AI.\n[*]Triumph Studios listens intently to its audience and delivers frequent, big patches.\n[*]Multiplayer can switch seemlessly between regular turn-based mode and a play-by-email system, in which people can play their turns, even if not everyone is online. This really helps with 4X games.\n[*]Triumph has released extensive modding tools, meaning the workshop is filling up nicely with a whole bunch of mods.\n[*]UI is really good at showing all the information to the player in crisp manner. I've actually shown it at work to inspire UX specialists :)\n[/list]\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to comment!", "timestamp_created": 1568463185, "timestamp_updated": 1568463782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620236575603485107", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "55104501": {"recommendationid": "55104501", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970343817", "num_games_owned": 950, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 10101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1442, "last_played": 1614172687}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, and I've always been a fan of the series,  but the multiplayer system is completely cloud based and doesn't let you load backups.

But the fact that they had a perfectly working system in their last game just really drives me up a wall.  Why not have Aow3's multiplayer system where everyone can make and keep their own saves?  Why not have it as an option?  It's so much more stable and leaves the players in control, and it lets you do fun house rules like \"If I can take your capital lets just reload the save and have you become my vassal till the game ends so no one has to sit the game out.\"  Or \"lets reload the backup save I made from the VERY beginning and intentionally do different things to see how the game turns out.\".  These were all things I did, and could do in the last game that got lost for an \"adaptive multiplayer system\" that has basically no benefit whatsoever for us.\n\nAt the moment,  the prospect of losing all your progress to a single bug has completely killed the desire to play multiplayer for my entire friend group and we played AoW3 multiplayer for over 100 hours apiece.  Since multiplayer was the biggest appeal of the game for us and no one wants to play it again after our experience with bugs,  this one thing really does ruin the whole experience.\n\nPlease patch in a multiplayer system that isn't entirely cloud based as an option.  Or at the very least, make the repair system actually functional.  Even if the bugs that corrupt saves beyond repair are rare, knowing that it can happen and there's nothing you can do about it makes multiplayer stressful and unfun.\n\nEdit:\n\nSo it's been ages, and the game was largely stable.  I must have played 5 or 6 games with just one other friend that had no real issues whatsoever.  Even after the first expansion came, it remained perfectly fine.   I was gonna revise my review to a positive one at some point. Then the new expansion, invasions comes out, and it's suddenly making multiplayer games unplayable again.\n\nWhile the \"not your turn\" bug has not cropped up again, having to constantly repair turns, redo combats, which may not go the same way the second time around, and constantly feel the threat of save corruption hover over your head like the sword of fucking damocles is not a fun multiplayer experience.\n\nNone of this would be nearly as bad of a problem if the game let me control saves and sub out/in players like AoW3 did.

I've seen a very wide range of reviews, and that is quite understandable, given how daunting Planetfall is to a newcomer. Actually, even for former Age of Wonders diehards (who haven't played the series in a while), I would say the game is not very approachable at first. I absolutely love turn based strategy and tactical games, yet my first couple of hours of Planetfall were a bit of a slog.\n\nThe tutorials aren't great. They are well meaning, but really only walk you through some mechanics and a lot of game concepts that can quickly become overwhelming. I don't know if they work for other people, but for me they didn't capture the essence of what I must do to expand, thrive, and win. They didn't explain a lot of the more nuanced mechanics of combat, or what things like \"8* chance of inflicting soulburn\" actually mean. That said, it was worth struggling through it, and doing some quick google searches to better understand nuances.\n\nI feel like the campaigns, while making a really good effort at introducing the world and story, don't show Planetfall at its best. This is a shame, because I love the concept. Yet, a 4X game like this really doesn't lend itself well to micromanaged storylines with a ton of specific linear story missions. 4X games by their nature thrive when letting you just go out and colonize the world and grow your empire organically.\n\nWhen I started playing scenarios, that's when I really started seeing the true genius of the game. There is an incredible amount of options, so much potential for modifications, and really great flavor to boot. Amazons and Assembly are particularly memorable to me, though I found the default Vanguard guys to be a bit underwhelming (probably by design, they are the most generic and really don't bring the flavor of the other groups.)\n\nThe more I play, the more I uncover. There is just so much to like here... the pace is somehow fantastic once you get the hang of it (initially I was put off and thought it dragged, but that's really more because I had no idea what I was doing). Once you get the hang of it, development actually happens pretty quickly. The Civ-like parts of it play out much more quickly which is great (I love Civ but it's way too slow for me, I just don't have that kind of time anymore). The tactical battles feel random at first, but once you start understanding strategies and troop mods, you really start to figure out how to play each faction to their strengths.\n\nI worry that the game is so huge in it's scope and ambition it will put most people off.

The new province system, while not being unique, is quite the change from the old hex system and has been finely implemented. The development of those provinces can paint a picture of how good and where your empire is good at various tasks. Being able to actually integrate other races cities and units into your own is not new, but the added element of then being able to research some of their unique techs has been really enjoyable. What races techs will stack with other races units and so forth makes for some wonderful complexity of battle. The added element of the unit battle being turned based tactical excitement is something I really enjoy. I do not miss the days of token bump and grind.\n     The design elements in race/tech select are very enjoyable. They also add greatly to the replay-ability of the game over all. The worlds are highly morphic with several different meshing environments to contend with. Each has a different aspect that will effect city development. Even the races are morphic with the added options of \"secret techs\", no 2 Vanguard or dreaded insectile Kir'ko swarms you encounter will truely be the same. \n     What makes this game a right masterpiece though isn't that it is light in bugs (however congratulations on the teams that put this together and stamped out various bugs, this has been one of the smoothest game launches -- with just about everything seeming to work on install), but rather that the developers have spent some time and effort to add in little bits of flair. Not all void-tech units will be exactly alike for example. Promethean Amazons have blast bows, because of course they do!

It stands head and shoulders above AOW3 to the extend where aside from the setting there is nothing that would want me to go back to AOW3. \n\nWhile Planetfall was already a fantastic game at launch (c.f. original review below) it did have some issues, in particular a somewhat simplistic, though at the same time confusing, empire building gameloop. However every single issue with the game has been patched over the last year. Empire building is fantastic now, with the option to play wide or tall, with the option to concentrate on miliary/mobility (there are teleport station that hugely improve the movement armies in the late game) or economic development. They added a number of faction-specific buildings and perks that differentiate the way you approach the game depending on who you play as. If you haven't played this since launch or were turned off by some of the issues, give it another go, it is quite different now.\n\nThe latest free patch introduced an endless  'campaign mode' which is just insanely good and fun to play. What it basically is is a way to get a sense of progression between individual random games. Your heroes grow in level between games, but you also start building a repository of stuff that you can bring along to your games. This could be units that are not typically accessible to your faction or special operations, or mods (more on mods later). This allows you to shore up weaknesses in your faction or create crazy new combinations that really make you feel more powerful game after game (want to bring a tier IV from another faction along? you got it!). Your heroes also rejoin you game after game (albeit without their loadout) which makes you become more attached to them than the random heroes that pop up. This game mode is so much fun that I don't think I would ever go back to single random maps. \n\nWe also have anomalous sites, mini-expeditions dotted all over the map that can result in some rather unique weapons, mods, skills, operations and gives you a lot to do in the mid-game outside of constant warfare. Some of those rewards are just insane, e.g. an operation that allows you to create 2(!) clones of any unit during battle, and are just really really fun to further customize your game. The latest expansion has also add a 'grail hunt' which is like one mega-expedition that gives you a massive reward, but will require a fair bit of resource dedication and detract from what you should be doing.\n\nFinally let me talk about mods again. This for me is, hands down, the best aspect of the game. Every single unit can be upgraded with dozens of mods. Some of them are simple, just adding a bit more damage, or defense, but others can completely change the way a unit operates on the battlefield. The genius of this is that it keeps your low(er) level units relevant into the late game. You know how in AOW3 you basically had T4 stacks by mid to late game. This is not the case in AOW:Planetfall. You can give a lowly T1 melee unit a mod that turns it into a AOE ranged unit, allows it to jump around the battlefield, gain ressurgence, etc. All of this leads to highly customized armies and each game results in very different compositions depending on what you research/find and what the enemy brings to the field. Even after almost 400 hours played I still find combinations that interact in new ways and make my otherwise obsolete units really shine. This is particularly true with the new campaign mode where the number of options has just exploded.\n\nOverall AOW:Planetfall is a gem now, easily in my top 10 all times games, and on my 'desert island' list for sure.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n\nPlanetfall is an awesome game. Packed with features, tons of strategy and tactics, meaningful decisions, well thought out tech trees, huge replayability and very stable.\n\nI bought AOW3 when it came out and could see its appeal and really enjoyed the battles but for some reason could never really get into it. The strategic layer was lacking and it felt that only the Class really matter whereas all Races were kind of the same. AOW:Planetfall is very different, every Race is vastly different, and the depth that comes from combining Factions, Secret Techs, minor factions is amazing. The strategic layer is also hugely improved, I really like the sectors and the way skirmishes at the border can flip them around. The landmarks further add to the strategic depth, making colony placement much more significant. I just wish there was a way to see at once all the bonuses that apply, but that can easily be remedied by a patch, or a mod.\n\nFinally the Mod system is pure genius. The amount of customization options is mind boggling. With the right mods my tier I units can stay relevant until the end, something that never was the case in AOW3. Heros can switch Mods (and Weapons!) on the fly, meaning you can turn an almost impossible battle round with the right counters.\n\nFuture expansions will only make this even better.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough!", "timestamp_created": 1567976229, "timestamp_updated": 1605513474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503004670143127441", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "55023843": {"recommendationid": "55023843", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133990188", "num_games_owned": 761, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 10300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "playtime_at_review": 843, "last_played": 1618978340}, "language": "english", "review": "Dont get me wrong, I suck at this game.

Looking at my playtime with many in the genre will show that. I do though enjoy Triumph Studios games immensely!\n\nAge of Wonders Planetfall is another outstanding addition to their library. Coming from Age of Wonders 3, I had very high expectations and hope for this game when released. ( Preordered Premium Edition). Those expectations have been achieved and then some. \n\nThere has been two updates so far since release that have cleared many of the minor bugs ( very few at release) and balanced the game out better. Is it still needing tweaks? Yes. Are they major? No where near IMO. \n\nThe campaign (tutorial) is way better than what AOW 3 had. It is more interesting and gives you the opportunity to play the 6 different Factions  (classes) available so far. Gives you various victory conditions so you can try out different strategies on each map. Some do not give options but most do. The only thing is that it will take you time to identify and understand the research trees and the effects they have during gameplay. I'm at 65hrs game time and still learning as I go.\n\nEach faction has the same basic city building and progression, but with added differences for each faction. They \"DO NOT\" play the same. Weapons, buffs, weapon and character mods do have influence on the grand scheme. \n\nThe UI takes a bit to get the hang of, but is very informative and serves it purpose well. The map has a lot of information on it also and is easy enough to scan over and explain things in different sectors that have been uncovered from the fog of war. Various structures can grant benefits in different ways. Either for city production or troop buffs.\n\nOne of the BIGGEST PRO'S to me is the AI. If you play mainly against the AI in single player or co-op you will see that they put up a very good fight. No they are not perfect, but are one of the best I've played against even on easy. I still haven't tried bumping it up yet. \n\nI've played both campaign solo  and co-op against AI with a friend with no connection issues. Very easy finding saved multiplayer games in menu. Graphics are clean and more than adequate. I play on a gaming laptop (1050ti) and almost can run it maxed with very little frame drop.\n\nThe devs have been addressing all issues that players have brought to their attention about game balancing and bug issues and are very informative of their updates. I can't recommend this game enough. \n\nThank you Triumph and Paradox for an outstanding game!", "timestamp_created": 1567966380, "timestamp_updated": 1568008817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.796928524971008301", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "55021449": {"recommendationid": "55021449", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970863654", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 27494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2208, "last_played": 1607138896}, "language": "english", "review": "Civ in the streets, xcom in the sheets!", "timestamp_created": 1567959904, "timestamp_updated": 1567959904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "55015433": {"recommendationid": "55015433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114262475", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 2932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 503, "last_played": 1603930235}, "language": "english", "review": "Fell in love with it.

I think I can fairly judge this game.\n\nSo before anything... I will be honest that I didn't expect much from this game at all, it was one of those games where I was like \"Eh why not\" since I did like the Age of Wonders series of games... Now here are my pros, cons and misc.\n\nPros:\n-Great Artwork\n-Good Soundtrack\n-Great strategic opportunities\n-All factions have a unique feeling to them, yet play fairly similarly.\n-Feels like Age of Wonders 3 but better\n-Feels rather balanced\n-Great amount of Lore\n-Rather solid campaign\n-Decent Visuals\n-A good panoply of units per main factions and let's not forget the minor factions and Secret Techs\n-Good balance between beginning, middle and endgame.\n-I love the Mod system that allows lower tier units to stay relevant from all game stages (Example With the proper Mods A few Vanguard Troopers (Tier I) can more than adequately stand their ground against higher tier units.)\n-I enjoyed the diplomacy and the Casus Belli system in the game, though some minor refinements can be made to it. (Example different posture and expression when the other faction dislikes you. Minor reminders on how many turns did you do a diplomacy status change).\n-A good number of mods and equipment that your Character/Hero/Commander can equip.\n\n\nCons:\n-Sometimes a bit... Stereotypical Sci-fi\n-Occasionally the AI can be a vicious idiot\n-Can be a bit of a grind on occasions\n-The voice acting is bland\n-Naval battle feels kinda meh (Can be fixed!)\n-Some effects feel a bit limp\n-Not the best animation.\n-Campaign feels a bit clich\u00e9 at times....\n\n\nMisc:\n-Oh god, some of the unit comments made me laugh... Never play a prank on an LT with chocolate and healing salve from your PUG\n-*Hums Ride of the Valkyries*\n-There are some good cluster fuck opportunities with friends in this game\n-Burning things with plasma can be fun\n-Feels like an Age of Wonder game but Sci-fi!\n-SO MANY LASERS!!!!\n\nFinal note:\nDo I recommend this game? Oh yes I do! This game has a great mix of tactical and strategic depth in here. There is enough love for most Sci-fi fans out there. Though at times the campaign can feel a bit bland, it works and gives you an idea on what's going on... Where you will have the most fun is in the skirmish/scenario mode with enough variance and fun to go around. IMHO this game is worth the price tag... Now compared to Age Of Wonders III, it feels far more polished, more meat on it's bones, more features that I find a shame that AOW III didn't get that sort of polish. Now let's hope the DLC will contribute to it in a good way. Now if you're a fan of 4x games, Age of Wonders and Sci-fi, then this game is definitely for you!\n\n**Updated due to a sentence here that was incomplete.

You will rediscover old-world tech, you will customize your troops with new tools and weapons. Turn-based combat plays a huge role no matter your preferred gameplay. You will be fighting the local wildlife, 'barbaric natives,' and other rivals with imperial ambitions of their own. Research goes by quickly, and you can 'win' a single-player game in about 2-3 hours if you beeline your endgame objective.\n\nYou are NOT building an empire from humble beginnings that eventually achieves great social, cultural, and technological breakthroughs. There is no sense of grand strategy, no satisfying progression that comes with discovering great secrets or making monumental decisions. I was hoping this was the case, but I didn't get that feeling of satisfaction I look for in 4x titles.\n\nTLDR\nBuy Planetfall if you like tactical turn-based combat with light 4x elements.

If you are strategy gamer that prefers economic micro management and resource management, this is not the game for you.\n\nFor players who do like combat, this is the best combat strategy game on the market. The game has 6 economically similar races, but vastly different combat capabilities. These races combined with the 6 secret technologies and the 5 minor NPC factions enable each game to feel different. Even some of the less obvious combinations can have very powerful effects.\n\nThese different combinations get enhanced by the mod system in game. Each unit can have up 3 mods based on their unit type. One design choice I appreciate for the mods is they generally avoid just increasing damage or defense. The mods always do another effect that is more interesting than that, some of which can change a units role. One example is a fire round for guns, that changes ammo into a light explosion effect, causing AoE damage. The mod system can make some late game units and combinations feel broken, which is always fun in a mostly singleplayer game.\n\nThe units and mods all come together into the tactical combat. The normal gameplay occurs on a high level strategic view, but when two or more armies meet you can initiate a tactical combat. Each unit in the game has 2 or more abilities, and can have ever more with mods. Based on you and your opponents units and capabilities, it can allow for some intense combats and close victories.\n\nThe campaign consists of 13 missions, 2 per race with one final mission where you can pick who you want. As you play the campaign, you are given different choices in the mission which will affect the final mission, adding some decent replayability. While generally fun to play, some of the later missions can really drag along due to their requirement to eliminate many players on a large map. \n\nThe main gameplay mode is a random map generator. This RMG allows for a good amount of customization, along with offering some presets to get you started.  It is possible to do Free For Alls or pre-set teams based on your preference. In this mode there are 3 different ways to win, though I find the technology one to be a little easier than the other ones on larger maps.\n\nOne big complaint I have about the multiplayer is that there is no way to play without going through the Paradox servers. I do not like how this bodes for the future of the game in regards to multiplayer.\n\nPlanetfall even in its vanilla release has a great amount of content. Both Triumph and Paradox have a history of supporting their titles, so this should be the beginning of a long and fruitful update process. Triumph has already released 2 patches within one month. Age of Wonders 3 looks very different from its release version and I have high hopes that Planetfall will continue this trend.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1567824339, "timestamp_updated": 1567824339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541666686534881592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54991863": {"recommendationid": "54991863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023690281", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 4824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 536, "last_played": 1599403091}, "language": "english", "review": "Not very fun. its get better graphics but its the same game as Age of wonders 3 just reskinned.", "timestamp_created": 1567797905, "timestamp_updated": 1567797905, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450587987899780273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54990349": {"recommendationid": "54990349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042483215", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2154, "last_played": 1566831237}, "language": "english", "review": "Noice", "timestamp_created": 1567790260, "timestamp_updated": 1567790260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54980829": {"recommendationid": "54980829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011096139", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 134348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8772, "last_played": 1614393067}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been a gamer since age 7, played every strategy game and 4x from starcraft and total annihilation to civilization and endless space.

Every game I've been hyped for since, like forever, inevitably leads to a quick slide into what I call \"habit playing,\" when you keep playing a game either because you feel compelled to finish some campaign or achievement, or because it's what you like to play with friends, without any real \"rush\" of fun that I remember so vividly from playing games as a kid way back in the late 90s.

I played for 20 hours, but it's just become so repetitive! Much has been said about the different factions, and they are exciting... until you realise that the city building is exactly the same across the factions. Sure, they may look the different, but the inside is always identical.\n\nAlso, the campaign can be a little annoying at times. The choices offered aren't really clearly laid out in terms of consequence, the wars are irritating affairs of luck and attrition, and the autoresolve mechanic doesn't work as well as it should. Most annoying of all, allies don't help. I've called them to war, I've asked them to strike, and they do nothing, except maybe take out a marauder or two. They don't fight the actual enemy!\n\nI was expecting the campaign to be a sweeping story about the rebuilding of civilisation, but all I got was a series of barely connected stories about people I didn't spend enough time with to care about. Further, the loss of research between the two levels for each race made no sense. Why would my character and his people forget everything they learned on the previous map? That is dumb in a campaign, and is just a pain. That leads to another thing, the research. Aside from a little relabelling, the core research is the same across the factions. There is a little variation in military, but I wasn't feeling much distinct factional flavour, which was disappointing and, as I say, repetitive.\n\nI was really looking forward to this, I wanted to love it, but the story is very flat, very boring. It should have been great. Lost remnants of an empire return home to find it broken and set about rebuilding the great ideals of the past along with some local dinosaur-riding allies... but I didn't get any of that, it was all very generic, very uninteresting after a while. The problems with alliances are bad, the issues over autoresolve are worse. I am terrible at the tactical battles, relying on this mechanic to progress, and it was a real pain to work.\n\nI would imagine that the story problems can't be fixed now, but I hope they can at least fix the other gameplay issues before I start banging my head on my screen. For the moment, I can only recommend this to bored masochists. It's not terrible, but it's not worth full price, either.

I'll echo the voice of the crowd in the criticism of Paradox's \"release the framework of the game and build on it through DLCs\" strategy. I'll say, first off - the tactical combat feels really good. The game is adequately punishing and rewarding for good strategy, and charms with the great visuals in combat. There's some real charm to certain secret techs and special units, I can tell they put a ton of effort into it. When the rest of the game is structured, such as in the campaign, it definitely feels like a fulfilling empire builder with the special, flavoured sectors being pretty fulfilling to take.\n\nWhere the game kind of loses its' luster is in depth. For one, I feel kind of pigeonholed into rapid expansion by the sector system. Early game is a rush to plop down your first couple colonies and send your scouts out to claim vast swathes of area, otherwise you're in for a game of putting out fires with the AI as you expand into land near their forward bases, who sometimes just blatantly intrude into your area. Which quickly exposes one of the problems with diplomacy in this game: it feels pretty lifeless. There's some neat aspects - like buying access to claimed sectors, or the spying interactions, but overall it just seems to feed into a goal of conquering the planet. Which, if it's your thing -- you'll flipping love this game. But I think the game could have stood to use the neat quest interactions with minor factions to add more interactivity to inter-player diplomacy.\n\nAnd while I'm mentioning it, it feels really unsatisfying to play in - to Triumph's credit - such a visually charming world from what feels like behind a display glass. The world, to be frank, feels pretty non-interactive. It may be completely ridiculous, but I enjoyed endlessly playing a druid/celestial in AoW3 and healing the world, or bending the environs to better suit the structure of my civilization. Even excluding that, the sector system really just feels like you plop down a building with your unit and you sort of just get, + food from it, or + production. Roads just kind of happen, bases are always in the same spot... Maybe it's a little picky, but it feels like the world is there to trample over on the way to a conquest victory, not one to create a better world for your people.\n\nSomething feels missing. Which I see getting fixed, as Paradox has a great reputation of supporting their games - but at a price. You'll get a great first handful of hours out of this game. Worth $60 CDN? I'm not completely convinced, but if you're into strategy combat, I've played few games that top the experience.

It introduces many gaps; for example, even when we are attacking an enemy from exactly the same direction, whether the Cover is applied or not is depending on the distance.

(Guess more customisation options will come through DLC, the Paradox way!)\n The game doesn't feel like a new game, rather a reskin of Age of Wonders 3 which is blatantly obvious from the leader customisation screen and unit screens. The minimap is one unclear mess, especially when you play with a black colour and, regarding colour, they didn't learn anything from AoW3, as there are still too few colours which you can use to customise your empire. I cannot believe how this could get into the release, as there were Beta Testers so they had to spot these obvious faults. \n\nThe \"enormous\" map is rather small, not utilising the 64bit environment the game runs in, and it feels like they copied the maps right from AoW3 (which was 32bit). Maybe it is larger, but if it is, it sure doesn't feel it.\n\nThe NPC factions get annoying very fast. Their demands are too frequent and their quests are very repetitive; Either kill a certain amount of units or research some stuff. And that every few turns. \n\nThe races are a hit and miss, same as the units, and this was also the case in AoW3. You can see they used the same artists and copied most animations of units, albeit with a different skin. The animations are stiff and again make the game feel like an AoW3 Mod. The artist who designed the Amazons clearly needs to look at some more pictures of women as I don\u2019t know what he was smoking when he designed them. Luckily Tibbles is on the case to hopefully remedy the female characters through Modding. But how the Beta Testers missed that one too, is another mystery.\n\nOf course there aren\u2019t only negatives, they are in the majority than the positives, however.\n\nThe Map (excluding mini-map) looks beautiful. The shallow water (sometimes with reefs) and environment look top notch. They fixed one of the terrible annoyances of AoW3 too; Tier IV unit spam. You can now add mods to units, which makes Tier 1 units viable even mid- to late game. This was sorely lacking in AoW3 so kudo's for that! It\u2019s a shame that you probably won\u2019t get to see everything as the game ends rather quick, even on an enormous map. I had a conquest victory in turn 123 on an \u201cenormous\u201d map on normal difficulty. I never achieved a victory in Civ V (which this game borrowed heavily from) on the biggest map in 123 turns.  And this shows how small so-called enormous maps are. The Tech tree is expansive, but maybe too expansive for the duration of a game.\n\nThe manual battles look good but can get a bit unclear at times, especially when there are lot\u2019s of units in m\u00eal\u00e9e. Flying units can be a pain to target sometimes without having to fiddle with the camera, but the battles are enjoyable to fight. The \u201cspellcasting\u201d in battles is through tech you researched which can grant buffs to your units and damage to enemies and so on. They really were intuitive with that system. People compare the battles with XCOM, but other than the cover system, there really isn\u2019t much comparison. The mechanics are copied from AoW3 so if you were familiar with that, you feel right at home.\n\nThey fixed the missing sound-effects from release after two patches so that is good. I still wonder sometimes if they would've released the game on the same date if they were still independent as it felt like a bit rushed. The Swedish Overlords breathing down their necks.\n Of course every Paradox game needs a few patches to function, been so since the Hearts of Iron days, so the game has certainly potential to grow. And that\u2019s where it lies; The game will probably really begin to shine when the planned DLC\u2019s are released, which will hopefully add missing races and more customisation options. I hope it stays with these three planned DLC\u2019s though, but knowing Paradox, we\u2019ll  no doubt see DLC with 2 hairstyles and 1 pose for \u20ac 9,99 and more of those (Crusader Kings anyone?). Hopefully Triumph has some say in this and will not give in into those antics.\n\nFinal verdict; A game with a lot of potential but released too soon to justify the price. You will get some enjoyment out of it, especially if you like customising your ruler (albeit with limited options) and the first few games can be enjoyable, but you will come to realise it gets stale very fast. I waited with this review when I got some hours invested into it as I feel you can only then review a game properly, instead of the people who only played for under an hour and immediately put a negative (or positive) rating on it.\nWill update the review after some patches and DLC and hopefully it will change for the good as great 4X games are hard to come by.", "timestamp_created": 1566906466, "timestamp_updated": 1566909778, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723559260368347168", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54835517": {"recommendationid": "54835517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070022321", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 1523, "last_played": 1618886645}, "language": "english", "review": "Took a Spacer truck and slapped 3 different Celestian upgrades on it.\n\nCalled it the Religion Wagon\n\nGood game", "timestamp_created": 1566894018, "timestamp_updated": 1566894018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477348059415817261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54831989": {"recommendationid": "54831989", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970947742", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 4325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1096, "last_played": 1577852105}, "language": "english", "review": "enjoying it so far 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1566875826, "timestamp_updated": 1566875826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476700931787490845", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54818127": {"recommendationid": "54818127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087024883", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 168, "last_played": 1612262000}, "language": "english", "review": "I Like it, gotta get some more hours into it though.\n\ncombat, not a fan but it doesn't make the game bad.\nGraphics look pretty good for a 4x game.\nI like the way the city's work.\nThe maps look really good.\n\nthe only sad part is that the zoomed out maps aren't cool looking like the hand drawn ones in age of wonders 3.\n8/10 for a 4x game\n", "timestamp_created": 1566850114, "timestamp_updated": 1566850114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501160085201263428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54817346": {"recommendationid": "54817346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025901442", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1208, "last_played": 1566065940}, "language": "english", "review": "Combat is like  X-Com with more unit customization options.

The game has a lot to offer, a lot of new stuff compared to AOW3, some similarities to other games too.\n\nThe Good:\nUnit, faction and specialisation variety. There's 6 Factions and 6 specialisations all with their own units plus NPC factions with their own units and they all can be modded with 3 different mods. Insane amount of different stuff to try and use. A lot of flexibility and options.\n\nTriumph got rid of the physical and elemental resist system of AOW3. Instead now you have 2 different protection (Armor and Shield) against all damage and resistance against status effects like bleed, blind, stun..etc. Combine that with the ability to mod units and you get a system in which a levelled up tier 1 unit can stand it's ground against a basic Tier 3 or even tier 4 unit so AOW3 tier 4 spam is not necessarily a winning strategy in Planetfall, which is great.\n\nModding units gives you a lot of flexibility to design your units, make them glass cannons or \"tanks\" to soak up damage,you can give them AOE effects or change their Kinetic damage to Arc to be more effective against machines, you can give them extra health or health regen.. it's up to you. You can get mods and units from dwellings (independent NPC factions) too so the possibilities are almost endless.\n\nThe tactical combat has been reworked too. The most significant change is the cover system and the chance based hitting in which you can actually miss opposed to AOW3's system where you always hit, even if it was only for 1HP. Some people like it, some don't all in all with all the changes to combat combined, I prefer Planetfall's system to AOW3's\n\nThe Sector system is an another big change which I love. I remember how many times I started with a Sorcerer in AOW3 and wanted mana nodes but all I got was gold and production and when I started as a Warlord wanted gold and mana but found 8 mana to 1 gold and 1 production. Whit the sector system this is gone. If you need food you specialise your sector on food and expand to sectors where there's food. If you need Energy (money) than you just specialise on energy and level up your energy sectors. It's a lot more flexible system than AOW3 population and border based one. Basically sectors are your traditional \"mines\" but you can decide what sort of resource you want them to produce.\n\nThe other great thing is colony defences. You can build defensive buildings in your colony which provides you with militia units to defend your colony AND your sectors TOO which means your economy is protected and \"turtle\" strategy is a lot more viable option than ever before.\n\nOperations are great. Do you remember how annoying the constant Empire \"upgrade\" spell spam and disjunction spam was in AOW3? There was a mod to disable disjunction so you and the AI won't be able to remove spells from each other (wasn't a great solution either) It's all gone. Now you can still try to use some operations (spells) on each other but all faction has operation defences too with which you can lower the chance of success of any enemy operations.\n\nThese are the main changes that makes the game better than AOW3 and it seems Triumph has listened to all the community feedback they've been given to AOW3 and sort the biggest problems out in Planetfall so kudos to you Triumph Studios!!\n\n\nThe Ok:\nGraphics and Music and animations are ok but nothing spectacular. \nDiplomacy is ok at best but let's face it AOW was never about the diplomacy but the units, faction diversity and tactical combat.\n\nThe Bad\nSome of the voice over are horrendous (looking at you Dvar)\nThere's some bugs where the game just stops working,the battle doesn't end, some desync issues in Multiplayer (not too common) Some interface issues,information missing here and there...\nNothing major and I don't want to list them all here one by one but there's certainly stuff to work on.\n\n....And The BEST: That freakin' \"Eat Dust\" ability :D That just made me laugh. Some great sense of humour right there :)\n\nAs you probably guessed by now I'd absolutely recommend the game,even at full price but it certainly isn't for everyone. \nNot a diplomacy based game, not a Civ-like empire building either, although the economy is important to support what the game is GREAT about which is tactical combat. \nIf you're into unit customisation, unit diversity, finding and using faction, unit and mod synergies to find a combination that suits your play style the best and use all that to conquer the world than this is the best game for you to pick up and play.

Its refreshing to play a game that doesn't feel half finished like alot of \"AAA\" titles recently.\n\nWhile the core of the game is essentially the same, the changes increase the strategic choices dramatically.

Now you can rush any tech that suits your strategy.\n\nI also enjoy the changes to the colony growth. Before the radius just grew outward. Now you can plan the colonies expansion and grab those coveted special locations.\n\nI will say that tool tips and symbology could use some work. While the tooltips are pervasive the tend to still leave questions and wish you you could drill further. For example, many weapons or equipment modules will say something like \"when unit deals shock damage there is an 8 strength chance to cause electrified\".\n\nWell what does electrified mean? Its obviously a debuff. Specifics you get by shooting someone then examining there unit card to hover over that effect.\n\nSymbology is similar. Am i looking at stategic resistance?

You can even call in airstrikes and satellite lasers if you\u2019ve unlocked the tech!\n\nThe game\u2019s setting and design is fantastic. I\u2019m usually not a fan of the slightly crazier designs of sci-fi and fantasy, but in this game it feels right and works really well. Each faction is distinct in both visual and gameplay style.\nI\u2019ve enjoyed trying out all the factions, from your typical human spacefarers (the Vanguard), the espionage and stealth tactics of the Syndicate and the Amazons, a fun blend of Atlantians from Aquaman and the Navi of Avatar.  There\u2019s even space Dwarves in the shape of the Dvar and space Zombies (Necrons/Borg)!\n\nThe single player campaign is well put together with a great story for each faction.  It reminds me a lot of the campaigns of classic games such as Starcraft and Command & Conquer.\nThere\u2019s also a whole lot of back story for this universe you\u2019re exploring which is slowly revealed during the campaign, which adds to the worldbuilding and immersion.  And exploring is a big selling point for me, each game feels new with different challenges and things to discover.\n\nMultiplayer is really strong as well, with an unusual but excellent way of running player turns. Like games such as Civilization you can opt for alternating or simultaneous turns on the campaign map, but you can pop on even without the \u201chost\u201d being online to take your turn, log off and it\u2019s ready for the next player to do their actions.  This is great for carrying on a game, especially if your friends aren\u2019t always available to play.\n\nThere are a few negative points but these are very minor. The developer has released a solid game and though I\u2019m sure they will update it to improve quality of life, the game is complete and runs smoothly (at least for me).\nIf you love strategy games, love sci-fi and are looking for something new but familiar, then I highly recommend Age of Wonders: Planetfall.\n", "timestamp_created": 1566739901, "timestamp_updated": 1566739901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503687739372253418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54795139": {"recommendationid": "54795139", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985505318", "num_games_owned": 670, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 596, "last_played": 1617565360}, "language": "english", "review": "Nope.

I started on Civ the boardgame in the 1980s, I then went onto the first Civ PC game. I find that despite the fact that 80% of the games that I buy are 4x and nothing newly released in the genre should hold any attraction anymore, this game has aspects that improve upon the concept.\n\nThe best improvement in this game  that I can think of at the moment is that it has more freedom of action.\nExample: Many 4x games only allow your units to attack once per turn. Someone in the industry long ago decided that once you attack, all of your movement should be used up for that turn.\n\nIn this game, if your unit has 32 movement points and can reach enemies in multiple locations with said points, you can attack multiple locations in a single turn. Finally! Someone has designed gameplay that I can get into and rock with.\n\nDown with artificial restrictions! If you frackin' have the points/ammo/power to do something, do it! \n:-)\n\nBTW: I tend to hate diplomacy in games (and real life...), in this game I am having the time of my life wantonly killing every faction that I run into. Talk? We don't need no stinkin' talk! Die Sucker! Ah, it's time for a beer! This is the Life!\n\n*Can someone tell me which room the Evil Overlord 220 course is in this semester? I hear that Professor Bane is teaching it. :-) Thank you!\n\nBTW: The art work is some of the best that I have seen in PC games and somehow the music is clever enough that it doesn't become boring after it loops. It's like a perfect action movie soundtrack. Nicely done on both counts.\n\nAddendum: The more I play, the more I respect the designer's efforts. This game is VERY user friendly. I love the end-of-turn reminders if you have forgotten to set research or move a unit.

There\u2019s no penalty for expansion so the only strong strategy is to play wide and grab as much land as fast as possible. Units can have tons of different compositions, but maintaining them battle after battle takes a lot of time and micro. \n\nI like management type games. But this game feels like there is a correct (strongest) choice to make, and either you pick correctly or not. And once you know the correct way to build things, it\u2019s just a matter of going through the motions.

This becomes tedious after a while.\n\nThere is no drawback to popping out as many colonizers as possible. Managing large numbers of cities is not fun.\n\nYou can have huge numbers of units but the combat is almost never challenging. You can always see exactly what your going up against. If your going on the offensive, there should be no reason to ever lose a fight. The autocombat can occasionally lose you a unit, so you'll want to manual combat much more than should be needed.\n\nIf the AI was aggressive, the game could be much more exciting. However, the AI doesn't produce units/stacks that can keep marching through your territory taking cities. \n\nIf you do lose a city, you'll have a number of turns to take it back. This game mechanic isn't great. You can end up having to wait 10 turns for a city to flip fully to your side. Slows the game down even more.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nUpdated review below. 6/13/2020\n\nSadly my original review still makes important points. Played 2 games with version 1.3. I don't own the two DLC but its nice they are still updating this game.\n\nThe AI is better but still lacking. They don't seem to produce any Tier 3 units in my games. I end up easily conquering neighboring empires and then can achieve one of the victories without any trouble. This is on the harder AI difficulty.\n\nThe AI seems to stop expanding towards the late game. Not sure if this is due to poor city management or being bad at research. \n\nIts also poor at setting up its battles. If you have 2 stacks of 6 you need to defeat. You bring 4 stacks of 6 and don't lose any units. The AI doesn't do this. It frequently loses units that it then needs to replace.\n\n4x strategy games typically take many hours to complete a game. Literally 99% of people are playing single player. If you want to do multiplayer, your playing some other type of game that can be completed much quicker. Therefore 4x games need to have a good AI opponent or they just aren't fun.

Better combat UI that tells you everything you might need to succeed in tactical battles (in which up to 7 stacks of 6 units can take part). Huge variety of units that you can get from 6 playable factions, 5 NPC factions and 6 'secret' techs, each of them having a number of race-specific and unit-specific traits. Units can now be upgraded with hundreds of modifications that you can get  from your faction, secret tech, NPC factions that you are friendly with, and weapons research. There are also hero-only modifications and weapons, some of which are extremely powerful that can only be retrieved from landmark locations, places on the world map that are a variant of AoW dungeons. To say that this game 'lacks content' is to be, without a doubt, wrong. It's very much comparable to what AoW 3 had at the launch as well.\n\nOne of the noticable changes from AoW3 is the new 'map sector' system that might be recognizable to you if you ever played Endless Legend(although it only looks similar, in reality it's its own thing and nothing like what EL has). It has to be said, that there is no right or wrong opinion on whether it is an improvement or detrement compared to previous Civ-like 'build cities wherever you want' kinda system; you have to ask yourself the question if you like it or not. But i personally quite like it.\n\nSome other facts: the game has a campaign consisting of 13 maps, as well as rng map generator that allows pretty deep customization(also, it is quite good). The story here is somewhat unremarkable though, but if you like sci-fi genre of 'fallen civilization, broken apart into many factions that now after 2 centuries have to get to terms with each other', you might find this one interesting. There is also cloud-supported multiplayer with several modes, but i havent looked into it. The game also supports Steam Workshop, and comes with modding tools which are unfortunately largely undocumented. Still, there are already some interesting mods available to download.\n\nCommon mentioned negatives: soundtrack/sound quality is either hit or miss. (as well as quality of some animations). \n\nSome people don't like UI, but in my opinion it's actually quite good(and getting better with each patch). The only bad thing i have to say about it is that City UI could be better(there are 3 tabs populated with build options, one for units, one for city improvements and one for sector improvements. I still constantly forget that the 3rd one exists, i think that it probably better be merged with the 2nd one).\n\nI wont talk much about AI, i still have to see a 4x game with a perfect AI. In tactical battles it's mostly very good; it will punish your mistakes and it doesnt make outrageously stupid things. On strategic map it's an OK, it will attack you if it sees an opportunity, and will try its best to protect its cities(with somewhat varying results). \n\nTotal score: 8.5/10, definite buy.", "timestamp_created": 1566678704, "timestamp_updated": 1566678704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598149895668029785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54786399": {"recommendationid": "54786399", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978816709", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 339, "last_played": 1567140437}, "language": "english", "review": "This game pretty much pans out as a passable 4x.\n\nIt's probably best described as \"Endless Legend: But I Really Want to be Warhammer 40k\"\n\nNot only that but its slower than Endless Legend and doesn't have nearly as much functional customization before running off to launch the game.\n\nAs far as specific standalone complaints without comparing to existing games...\n\nEverything is just 10% too slow, response times, extra clicks to resolve things, combat interactions, map changes...\n\nEven after only playing the tutorial I look at the campaign and find it daunting as something I would even want to play as I have low expectations for the enjoyment I am going to get.\n\nBuildings/Technologies/Units aren't very clear on what you ACTUALLY get.\nA good example is by taking the borg/Necrons + Zerg/Tyrannid combo for a faction I expected to be the ultimate necromancer. \nIt more panned out that I got another unit every 3-5 battles and my units had some better health regen in/after fights.\n\nAnother example is weapon ranges, it's very hard to predict where you are going to be able to shoot to from any particular position, or even if different ranged weapons even have different ranges.  What looks like a sniper rifle appears to have marginally better or not better at all range than an assault rifle, and the shotgun which traditionally has short range is barely distinguishable range from the assault rifle.\n\nMany buildings are very abstracted from any specific benefit by adding job slots, which while you can sort it out, doesn't really help establish if I'm actually gaining a benefit from just having the building, or if adding people is necessary...\n\nExpanding seems very slow.  Maybe it was my start, or my faction, but exploration is 100% manual, most expansion is based on population, and colonizing vehicles seem pricey, especially if you intend to actually upgrade your troops.\n\nI'm not sure if there are even blanket upgrades to troops or if they only 'improve' through xp and mods. I'm not even sure what kind of improvement they were getting from xp.\n\nOn the upside, there are a lot of sliders when creating your commanding hero's appearance.\n\nIt's possible future content and patches can make this game faster/clearer/stronger.

Something I will never disagree with.\n- Combat mechanics in some regards. Some unique abilities like entrenching or overwatch.\n- More extensive scenario settings. Although it's lacking in some regards.\n- Garrison feature where you get free units to protect your prime sector hex. I really like this.\n\nNegatives:\n- UI. Everyone talks about the UI being garbage. I completely agree.\n- No retaliation in melee/limited. Your units/heroes/whatever just take attacks without fighting back.\n- Range having accuracy like in Xcom. Should have stayed in Xcom and not have been added to Aow.\n- Sectors. Some people seem to like or feel neutral to it. I absolutely hate it.\n- Character/race customization. Little customization even when compared to base Aow3 and not a fan of some of the humanoid like races. The races aren't super bad, but they aren't good either.\n- Having to redo scenario/map customizations everytime i start a new game. Your settings don't save.\n- Diplomacy is more frustrating in this game (not because it's hard/complicated, but because the ai wants you to constantly do shit for them with little in return and annoy you at every turn).\n-EVERYTIME you start up a new scenario, all the settings you had for a previous map that you customized reset. That's right, it does not save your settings from a previous game, you have to do it all over again.\n\nIt tried to reach for different aspects of other genres, and ended up being a disappointing mess.

In the latest edition of the Age of Wonders series, there is an X-Com style of combat, with up to 35 extremely diverse in roll units a battle running around a combat grid blowing each other to smithereens!

You also pick a Secret Technology, drastically changing your playstyle for each faction, allowing for virtually endless customization. Do you want to burn the heretics in flame? We got you. Do you want to infect the world with a horrible super virus that eventually bursts out monsters from the corpses of the infected? We got you. Do you want to bring Psionic wrath down upon your opponents? We got you. Teleport everywhere? You came to the right place. There are many more, of course, but you can discover them by yourself. The overworld map plays a lot like a Civ game, with many different resources to manage and technology to research, so that your armies can crush the enemy's many cities.

Planetfall.\n\nPlanetfall is more like an extensive mod to AOW3 than a new game. Most of the battle mechanics are the same and the engine is definitely the same. The heroes are 80% the same and the race+class+proficiency selection and outcome is the same.\nJust switch magic for technology. The similarities are so striking that after a few hours you feel like you are playing AOW3 with some crazy modder's skins. \nOne thing I have to give Triumpth is that they did spend the effort to make sure there was a variety of units. Well done.\n\nAs you play it you find so many things that just sting your soul and you think \"Oh, I cant believe they did that. I will have to mention that on the review\" but when you finally write it, you have nothing except that bad taste in your mouth.\n\nI am mostly disappointed with the game because I went all in and pre-purchased the Premium package since I believed and trusted Triumph that much. To give you context of the significance: I almost NEVER spend more than $4 on a new game. Which reduces my shopping to games on 60-75% discounts.\n\nMaybe this Planetfall pill would've been easier to swallow had it not been Age of Wonders but rather just a different series done by Triumph.

It's just hard to look at and doesn't contrast well with the 3D world. The scan lines on the text boxes make them hard to read and just add visual clutter. I didn't even notice the buttons at the top left initially because they blended in with the game world.

They can also expand at a quicker rate then you can having multiple cities and sectors  and set up forward bases everywhere making it near impossible for you to expand. so i set it down to easy same problems occur again by about turn 30. so i try very easy and early game you tear through everything without any problems the AI still get the same cheats though expand faster have more armies and higher tier units.  not a problem early game but as you push into the end game the same issues arrive your at war and the AI show up at your doorstep with 6 full stack armies even if your ready for them and have what ever armies you can field out i found 4 all with mods and thats while focusing on energy output.  so your either pushed back by that or you beat them just for another AI player to show up at your doors with another 6 full stack armies. your allies wont help either they are more likely to cancel the alliance and declare war on you too.

There lies in front of your eyes one of the planets from the old Star Union Empire, led by the Empress Carmania, the leader of your ancestors. What were the reasons for the fall of this Empire, and are there any survivors who could help you understand.  It\u2019s time to find out, as you\u2019re about to land on the first planet of Age of Wonders: Planetfall!\n\nAge of Wonders: Planetfall is a 4x strategy game with a turn-based combat system, developed by Triumph Studios and Published by Paradox Interactive on the 7th of August 2019. The game is available on PC (steam), Xbox One and PS4 platforms.\n\nI must say up front that I haven\u2019t played any of the previous games in the series and therefore, I\u2019m not able to make any comparisons with the previous titles.\n\nThe game consists of 14 missions, including a tutorial. Whether or not you are familiar with this genre of game, I strongly suggest playing the tutorial, which is a small mission and will take you around 45 minutes to an hour to complete, and will give you a good understanding of all aspects of the game.\n\nWhen you are done with the tutorial, it will be time for you to choose between one of the three planets available to explore. You can choose your difficulty from Beginner, Advanced and Expert, as well as whether or not you want to have your hero resurrected after losing a battle. \n\nThe game has two phases; the first one is basically to grow your Empire, and the second is the turn-based combat phase. At the start of each game, your spaceship will land on the specific planet and create your base colony. You first goal is to acquire more lands surrounding your colony by sending a unit to a sector and building forward bases and claiming these territories. As your main colony grows, you\u2019ll have the ability to annexe these specific territories to that colony and choose what type of industry it will support: Energy, Production, Food or Research. The energy is basically the currency in this game and therefore, you must make sure you have enough of it in your treasury to buy new units and strikes during the combat phases. In terms of research, you have two trees; one for the Military, and the other for the Society. Both have 9 stages of research, with each stage having 4 researches to acquire. \n \nAs you move forward, you\u2019ll be able to purchase new units and structures, as well as operations. But you must have plenty of energy and Cosmite (essential material) at your disposal for your military units and gears to produce new buildings after discovering new society research.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to move your units and start exploring the planet, eventually meeting other races (as well as your own) who will give you quests that will help you discover the story of the planet. But be aware that the first time they meet you, your relationship will be fragile as they will most likely doubt your intentions. You can start with a diplomatic approach using the diplomacy tab, or just become a war mongrel, attack them and take over their territories. I must say that the Diplomacy options are very good and easy to use. \n\nWhich takes me to military units. You can merge up to six units, including a hero, to create an army. You have to make sure you have enough energy to create a unit, while equally ensuring that you have enough energy to keep your units alive. What I really like about the units is that you can customise them as you find new technologies. Yes, you\u2019ll get new units with specific technology, and you\u2019ll also be able to upgrade these units by adding additional technologies through the unit mod slots, of which there are three per unit. For example, your space marine starts with a machine gun, but by adding electrified ammunition and rail accelerators, your unit will now fire some sort of deadly electric laser. And there is plenty of variety, which is fabulous! Regarding your heroes, you can also purchase and change they primary and secondary weapons. All units will gather experience as they survive on the battlefield, but your heroes will gain experience points which you can use to purchase special skills for them.\nThe second phase is the turn-based combat and all you have to do is to move either one unit, or an army comprising six units, onto the tile where an enemy unit is located. If you have other friendly units next to the defendant or enemy figurine, they will automatically join the fight with you and vice versa.  During each turn, all units have 3 action points which they can use to move around, use weapons and activate abilities too. If you eliminate all enemies, you\u2019ll be the winner! You\u2019ll be fighting in different environments, including in deserts and on water, which is a lot of fun. Operations are also available in turn-based combat as long as you have enough energy points, but use them wisely as you can only use a few per battle.\n\nAlso, as you move from planet to planet, you\u2019ll be playing different races (6 in total, plus the Paragon faction) which gives you a bit of novelty as you have to learn about each of the races, units and research. One point I forgot to mention is that all maps (planets) are randomly generated, which gives you plenty of replay-ability. There is also a multiplayer mode.\nSplendid graphics and smooth soundtrack. The game runs very well and you\u2019ll be stuck to your screen for hours on end. The only annoying thing I encountered was the constant reminder that I have still units with movement left in them, either in battle or on the main map; this kept happening even after ticking the box to not be reminded. There are plenty of options and your can rebind keys if you wish to do so (thank God for that)!\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n+\tGreat Graphics\n+\tSingle and multiplayer mode\n+\tCustomise your heroes and units\n+\t7 races with their own units\n+\tGood and easy technology trees\n+\tGreat gamepedia\n+\tAchievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tAnnoying reminder before ending a turn if you haven\u2019t moved all your units.\n\nDive headfirst into Planetfall, an exceptional strategy game! A must-have for all fans of the genre.\n\n9/10  \n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

I could do with a few more units for each faction (still learning the game, so I could be wrong here), as it feels a bit light. But the inclusion of a \"secret tech\" for each playthrough lets you mix and match in units from these non-faction lists, so overall you have a good amount to choose from. \n\nThe NPC factions on the map also let you cheaply buy their units for the new influence resource, so more customization there. Still, would maybe like to see 1-2 more units for each race to mix if up a bit in early and mid game. I had a lot of the assault bikes and tanks for vanguard in every army as they just seem like the best mix of DPS and tank-i-ness. Support units feel a bit weak. But Heroes really shine with the equipment, mods and skills really allowing you to customize.\n\nI don't really have any cons here other than a handful of little bugs. Highly recommend for any 4X or TBS afficianado. Even Xcom-ers will love the tactical combat side.\n\nBTW - This is how you release a game in 2019 - feature complete and G2G after tons of alpha and beta testing. Very few performance or bugs (admittedly I am running a 2080 on an i7-7700k).\n\nGood effing work PDX and Triumph!", "timestamp_created": 1566230507, "timestamp_updated": 1566230507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562184989452362061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54698577": {"recommendationid": "54698577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083955074", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1390, "last_played": 1583496313}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.\n\n Should add a multiplayer mode which is just battles no over world stuff.

I expect that with patches and expansions it will get much better. \n\nA few pros:\n\n1) Engaging combat system\n2) The different factions/technologies play pretty different from one another, so there is value in playing a different way\n3) The game doesn't drag out too long like in previous AoW games\n\nCons:\n\n1) The map is really cluttered and hard to read compared to AoW3 and other games in the genre\n2) Diplomacy options are weak. The AIs feel really aggressive. I've never managed to ally with a single other faction. Everybody just denounces and declares war for seemingly no reason. \n3) I find a lot of the animations to be a bit slow. They recently put in an option to always have fast movement on for combat, but this is not the case on the strategic map. \n\nYour mileage may vary:\n\n1) After experimenting with all of the secret technologies, Xenoplague is the only one that I found really fun\n2) I'm not a huge fan of the sci-fi theme. I think I prefer the fantasy theme\n3) I don't trust Auto Combat to not lose my units, even in easy fights. If I have a 2 to 1 strength advantage, I will never lose a unit in manual combat. Auto Combat sometimes kills a unit. So playing through manual combats is a bit of a grind. Min-maxers will feel this pressure, while more casual players might not mind. \n4) I don't like the \"sector\" mechanic. I very much prefer building on a hex, and having influence expand from there.

Strategic points can only be used for \"spells\"/operations on the stratetic map and operational for actual battles. This actually motivated me to use stratetic spells and not just save my casting points for the \"actual battle\". \n\n5) Also a lot of damaging abilities are not just flat numbers anymore but %, which means they scale into the endgame. \n\n6)Damage types have been distributed far wider and better than in AoW3. Remember Poison? In theory awesome, too bad that almost every undead creature was immune, the whole goblins and dwarves highly resisted and so on... Imagine Goblin Rogue fighting wraiths, yeahh.... high physical and poison immunity. \n\nSo immunities as far as I can tell are gone. Every race has 2 damage types per se. \"Physical\"/kintec is now not the main damage type any more but just one of many. Certain races like the Syndicate don't even use physical but arc and psionic. \n\n\nSo every change I can see improves the overall gaming experience and will keep you at bay for months. \n\nIf you liked theprevious AoW and are ok with the Sci-fi setting, then you will LOVE this game.", "timestamp_created": 1566123875, "timestamp_updated": 1566123875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730812013149261475", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54678653": {"recommendationid": "54678653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198850061101", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2294, "last_played": 1567784096}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply include \"remember RMG setting\" will earn you additional likes.

No matter which path you choose, Age of Wonders: Planetfall is an addictive experience that is out of this world.\n\n[url=https://www.newgamenetwork.com/article/2184/age-of-wonders-planetfall-review/]Full review[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1565997826, "timestamp_updated": 1565997826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571096718311309814", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54654041": {"recommendationid": "54654041", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987668595", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 9134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2793, "last_played": 1610747280}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, improving over AoW3 in pretty much every aspect.

While it's not bad it just doesn't feel like Age of Wonders if it's not cheesy high fantasy. Kinda like if you played the next Elder Scrolls but instead of Altmers and Argonians you got Psychic Fishes and Cyborg Lizards, it can be a fantastic game but it doesn't feel like Elder Scrolls anymore. Also the music is meh, and some combat animations are glitchy.\n\nSo long story short, if you want a light mix of 4X management and XCom tactical combat you can buy this game.

I miss some mechanics there, some relations between NPC factions, their power&developement affected not just random spawns from thin air and quest/tribute spam.\n- Interface could be done better.

The latest free patch added a few features that really makes everything in the base game come together and feel a lot better. Residential districts can only be built on flat sectors without mountains, but they add an extra district slot each in addition to their own bonuses, bringing the total size of cities up to 7 which really makes the maps feel a lot more interesting. The map gen becomes important, you consider where to place your cities more, and you consider which districts to place in which sectors more. It's a very good change IMO.\n\nThe other free addition is a persistent campaign mode, which I am a sucker for and finally gives me a reason to finish maps. You start a galactic campaign, pick a random planet to invade which has some unique properties and sometimes victory conditions which changes up how it plays out, and then when you win you get exp for things like your heroes and the factions/classes which give you small bonuses and some starting boosts for your next game. This mode also allows you to create your own custom heroes to bring into the game, or to use your old existing leaders as heroes, which is amazing. Then you pick a new planet and play again. You aren't locked into one faction or a limited number of heroes, you can level up and progress all the factions/classes and switch between them at will in the same galactic campaign.\n\nPreviously I probably would have rated this game as like a 7, with the new residential districts and all the new exploration mechanics added in the previous patches, plus the persistent campaign mode it's probably more a solid 8.5, perhaps close to a 9.\n\nOriginal review below:\n------------------------\n\nBetter than AoW3, but not quite as good as it could have been, or could yet be. \n\nTo start, the game doesn't feel completely \"finished,\" like it was pushed out with a few things forgotten or not ready, mostly in the sound effects department. A number of weapon sounds and unit voices are missing, just a handful of ranged attacks, a larger number of melee attacks, most things have sounds so the few that don't tend to stick out and can be a tad jarring. Some of the melee animations I also want to believe are placeholders, because I can't see how they could be that bad with any effort put into them whatsoever. This ends up being a very minor issue because I found myself avoiding tactical combat as much as possible. Adding those sound effects in is probably going to be very low priority for a while since the devs are still dealing with a number of crash issues and broken mechanics. I feel it's worth mentioning those issues now even if they may be fixed in the future, as we are over week past release now.\n\nMechanically the combat system is pretty solid, overwatch and cover mechanics make it engaging, there's a variety of skills to use with various interesting synergies, if this was an Xcom style game that would all be great. It's not an Xcom style game though, it's a 4x, and combat takes entirely too long to deal with manually for any progress to be made at all in your overall campaigns. There are times when I fired the game up, fought a single tough battle, and that one battle took so long it exhausted me and I saved and quit after winning. You will be fighting hundreds of such battles per game. The other issue with combat, the bigger issue, is the AI is awful at using all these new mechanics and synergies, to the point where taking manual control of a battle feels like cheating and pressing an \"I win\" button even if you are grossly outnumbered. There are \"late game\" dungeon objectives on the map you have to defeat to unlock the strongest resource nodes (which can be extremely powerful nodes), they are filled with a mix of the higher tier units and only allow a single squad to enter (usually you can cluster your squads on the map and bring multiple into the same battle), they are like meant as a challenge even for a strong squad. I have beat these objectives using teams of basic scout units. Scouts as you can imagine are the weakest units in the game, meant for exploring not combat, that is how bad the AI is in manual combat. So I autobattle almost everything, and that said the autobattle feels relatively solid compared to other games since it is actually simulating the entire battle with all your units and skills, you can even watch a replay of it to understand what happened.\n\nThe usual 4x progression mechanics like research and city growth/management, Planetfall does MUCH better than AoW3. There are dedicated military and social research trees, and you have to actually get the tech to build the better buildings in your cities instead of just having them all unlocked instantly. Planetfall really does feel like a true full-depth 4x while AoW3 was a \"light 4x.\" A lot of the military trees are faction specific or \"class\" specific, making each game you play feel fairly unique in that area. The social tree on the other hand, there are only like 2 faction techs and 2 class techs on the entire social tree, everything else is generic and shared with every faction, which is a bit disappointing. For the most part every game you play you will progress your cities and empire the same way, with the same buildings and upgrades. There is at least progression there though this time.\n\nThe unit mod system is I think the biggest highlight of the game. There are a large variety of mods you can unlock based on your faction and class choice, and a few you can get from NPC questing stuff, you can mix and combine these mods to create some really interesting strategies. I would say it's one of the better unit design systems out there in the genre.\n\nExploration is a tad weak, scouting around the map gets you a few very small resource pickups and very little else of use. The sector system locks most of the map to a fairly rigid balance making most of the world bland, IE a sector is either a forest sector or it's not, it doesn't matter how many trees are there it's the same, so there is very little interesting worldgen. There is no autoexplore, and if one was added it would be almost entirely useless because the map is full of wandering enemies that are only just strong enough to hunt down and kill your scouts while accomplishing nothing else. You can usually avoid these enemies while manually scouting by sticking to the coasts and going into the water to avoid the land enemies and popping back on shore to avoid the ocean ones, an autoexplore would just instantly get your scouts killed but a lot of people are asking for it.\n\nThose are the systems I can think of offhand I feel worth highlighting.

The immediate tactical combat is satisfying, with varied options for how to handle a fight. Unfortunately problems are to be found everywhere else in the game and can best be summarized as variations of being bland. Planetfall goes out of its way (unintentionally) to be as bland as possible. \n\nA lot of it stems from the art direction for Planetfall being subpar at best. This leads to a host of problems that sour the entire experience. The primary examples are:\n\n1. Graphics blending together. Terrain on the world map lacks immediately obvious unique identifying traits which makes differentiating sectors more aggravating than it should be. Having no strong colours in the game's palette contributes to this. These problems also exist in tactical combat where it is harder to tell things apart than it should be.\n\n2. Cluttered UI. Not only does the UI take up a lot of space, it also provides little information in exchange for that space. \n\n3. No aesthetic appeal. The races and their units aren't visually appealing and varied designs are distinctly absent. There's no \"oomph\" to high-tier units either that makes them satisfying to acquire. Designing your own commander is also affected by the lack of appeal. Planetfall removes every avenue for making conventionally attractive characters that you would want to identify with as a player. There is also no point to having graphical character customization when you are given as few choices as you are here.\n\nGameplay wise it is difficult to make comments on what is and isn't balanced based on only 30 hours of gameplay. What can be said is that the empire management side is unsatisfying. Replacing domain radius with sectors isn't necessarily bad, but the options for what to do with them are incredibly limited. The resource points on the world map provide a lot less diffrentiation than the previous game's equivalents. City advancement is also strictly linear and wholly dependent on your research; this leads to forcing certain strategies.\n\nAs a final note the music follows suit with the rest of the game. There is only one memorable track in Planetfall compared to the numerous standout tracks in AoW 3. This is a real shame.\n\nTL;DR: Wanted to find out if gameplay is good or not, woefully lacking presentation makes it impossible to get there.", "timestamp_created": 1565948940, "timestamp_updated": 1565948940, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549052655696868896", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54641038": {"recommendationid": "54641038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106013105", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 4444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1828, "last_played": 1567199576}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really good turn based strategy and tactical combat game.

I think the problem is that the combination of different things that are going on in the game don't ever feel like they're particularly joined together. The result is something akin to being thrown a box of Lego without the instructions - you can probably make something nice if you put your mind to it, but it's much more difficult to come up with something coherent when you don't have a full clue what you're doing.\n\n- A lot of this is due to the tutorial being a bit lacklustre in explaining things, forgetting to mention key parts, and completely missing out explaining all the bells and whistles of the UI. Alot of important information on how to play the game seems to be completely missed out.\n\n- I can't quite work out the tone of the game - it seems to jump from slapstick to serious rather wildly. I appreciate the throwback to SMAC in the Research quotes, but I'm increasingly not liking them because they come off as incredibly dumb and inconsistent in their quality. I don't think anyone has ever tried SMAC quotes again because of this - you either have to be straight with your thinking or not do it at all. It doesn't help that the voice acting is pretty poor also. The whole game is almost schizophrenic in its choices - going from full on Flash-Gordon-Gay-Space-Communism; to Star Trek; to Hard Sci-Fi, all at once.\n\n- Whisper it, but I think Endless Legends might be slightly better. Obviously I understand that EL has has several major expansions on top of it, but purely from a characterisation and gameplay point of view, Endless Legends just makes alot more sense. The races in Planetfall are meaningless and cookie cutter compared to the extremely different and unique races that EL has. The overall aesthetic and quality of the game is clearer - basically EL knows what it's trying to achieve.

Combat feels more like XCOM, and it's fast, furious amazing and SO SATISFYING when you add in the sound and effects and destructible environments and variety of attack, defense, and \"spells\" i.e. Operations. The strategy is so rich and multifacted and I have yet to scratch the surface, even after completing two initial scenarios in 40 hours of game play. The variables are mind blowing. As is true with AOW, the artwork and lore are amazing.\n\nI know some people have attacked Planetfall's alleged lack of a cogent story, but honestly I have no idea what they are talking about. What's the cogent story behind Civ, EU4, MOO, Stellaris, etc.? It's TOTALLY the wrong way to think about this game and it's history. I love reading the humorous and imaginative backstories of the units and getting a feel for the ruins of a once great interplanetary empire. Plus, I actually enjoy the scenarios.\n\nTriumph and Paradox, in my humble 30 years of gaming, are still two impeccable outfits that pour nothing but L O V E into their creations without selling out (Activision and Bethy, my jilting Xes, I'm talking to you). I rarely buy games when they first come out since I want the bugs sorted out, the gameplay balanced, and I get a good bargain with \"anniversary DLCs\" and so forth.\n\nBut here I couldn't help myself, and it was the best gaming decision I made in a long time! and no I'm not a paid sponsor ;) This game is just so ... rich and unique, to my own surprise, I am just so loving it... it really scratches my Starship Troopers meets Dune fantasies (and other scifi tropes).\n\nI am sure with time, any problems with gameplay and grammar will be sorted out as they always are by Triumph and Paradox, and I can't wait for DLCs that I assume will add new aliens, doctrines and operations and so forth. This game will likely be a \"go to\" for 4x gaming on my computer for years to come. The biggest issue I will have is: AOWIII or this!\n\nTriumph, I salute you for taking a bold risk, and exploring a new genre.

AoW: Planetfall, in my opinion, is a beautiful game that hardly has any issues at all(a voice actor or two are fairly lackluster, but that is really it), and near-seamlessly combines both tactical and base-building strategy, making it a favorite for anyone who enjoys Civilization, X-COM, or the Total War series. The factions are fantastically done and blend together in a universe I am still discovering. Research yields not only new, fun tools to use in your game, but also quotes which give insight into the minds and struggles of the people who came before, while unit descriptions complete the immersion. The combat system, though a little rage inducing at times(AI focusing one unit to death), is enjoyable and mind-consuming as you decide to gamble a 50% chance to hit three times or a 70% chance to hit two times. My only real complaints, besides the couple voice actors who kind of ruined some lines for me, is the easily fixable addition of an ethereal main faction, and a need for a more cohesive way to piece together the stories of some of the characters you hear about from both unit descriptions and tech(mainly Mah Reg'Nib)into something that players can read, should the wish.\nAll in all, 9.8/10, worth every cent and then some.", "timestamp_created": 1565834067, "timestamp_updated": 1565834067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54622596": {"recommendationid": "54622596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042209381", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 4399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1307, "last_played": 1566403154}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game but total rip off.\n\nA nice upgrade to Age of Wonders 3 - graphics very pretty, music is fab, plus few new mechanics like tech trees and cover etc but not enough innovation to warrant a 40 quid 'plus' price tag.

It is a good game.   That was 5 years ago though.  The bar has been raised since then with other offerings and as the industry has evolved. \n\nAge of Wonders Planetfall is a good game, but to me it is a disappointment.  It really just seems like a mod/reskin of Age of Wonders 3 to be a sci-fi setting.  Most mechanics of the game, including the UI and tactical battles are almost exactly like Age of Wonders 3.  I would say it is 80-90% same as AOW3.\n\nThere is a lot going on with tweaking, unit mods, etc but it lacks something to draw the player in.  Someone mentioned in the discussion forums that it seemed to be lacking a soul, that something is missing to give it that wow factor.  I agree.  I have enjoyed playing it but nothing jumps out as a massive upgrade/improvement of its predecessor Age of Wonders 3.  So many things are the same, just rewrapped to be sci-fi instead of magic oriented.\n\nTo me the things that are missing that should be present in a game like this today are:\n\n* more voice acting and cut scenes to tell story and engage player.  I am really having a hard time getting into the story and lore just reading a few lines of text dialog here and there.\n* more in game detail.  I want to see info amd lore on quests, not just a one line of text.  I want to see details on structures with animated graphics of what the building looks like, not just an icon size picture with one line of text \n* voice acting for NPC characters in the game.  Just text based conversation in diplomacy is dated in my opinion.\n* I would like to be able to zoom into colonies and have them visually look different as they are expanded and structures added\n* an undo button.  how many times have you clicked in the wrong spot and sent your stack to the wrong hex or launched that laser strike on an empty hex.  :(\n\nSo is it a good game?  Yes.  Is it groundbreaking and significantly different than AoW3?  Not in my opinion.\n\nSo if you set your expectations that this is AoW3 reskinned as a sci-fi game, then you will not be disappointed.\n\nIt does not have the same AAA finish however as more recent 4x games like Endless Legend.  \n\nI was all in on this and pre-purchased the premium edition with season pass.

Its no Endless Legend regarding the factions and how different their gameplay was. But they all feel different somehow, especially in the combat tactics part. Oh and the combat is the best for me so far. I hated AOW3 and the Endless combat mechanics, just keep that in mind. It is too early to say, but so far trying  4 factions with various secret techs I went with completely different army compositions depending on the available mods, units etc... and this must be a good thing right? Its not only about damage types or the ranged/melee/flying types. The mods can make so much of a difference, especially mid to late game. Final thoughts, really solid strategy game. I like the world/lore, nothing ground breaking, but good enough to support the strategy part.

Quick prefix before getting into the fun content! I don\u2019t often do reviews but I make exceptions for when I have a good story to tell; I suck with being technical with reviewing games after all so I can only really do games justice with an ever so slightly dramaticized tale of something I have actually done in game! I made a review very similar to this one for AOW3 in fact and I believe I got an even better story out of this game than that, so take that as you will. With no further ado, let\u2019s have some story time!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nThe Amazons were in quite a predicament; after their boisterous leader, Regata, had a few too many drinks at her commonplace-parties she decided it would be a fun idea to insult the neighbouring Redeemers which resulted in them declaring war. Of course, they were just aching for an excuse to declare war anyway, Regata was not only a bloodthirsty warlord but a smart one at that, what was the issue with pushing things along while her armies were by their border? The issue was that the techno-zombies weren\u2019t as mindless as they looked. The full army of the redeemers was held in tight formation and with enough synthesized firepower to put a frontal assault on their army a very risky endeavour, thus Regata planned to sit in her fully armed and armoured city and goad them into attacking her where she had the home field advantage. \n\nUnfortunately, the redeemers continued to prove their tactical competence by hiking up the mountains to completely circumvent the militarized border city and instead beeline directly towards the vulnerable capital. This would be quite a problem indeed; the capital had an army defending it but not one that could hold their large army off, if Regata wanted to try and rush to its defence then she would be back in time to fight within it\u2019s smouldering ruin, not to mention leaving the other city undefended if the redeemers wanted to play another trick and turn around to hit the newly undefended border city. However, Regata in her war-like cunning saw a solution to this: Both her frontline armies and the capital guard would converge upon the redeemers in the mountains in a desperate and bloody assault! It would be the only way to take them on without a martyr. Thus, the massive battle began; the Amazons encircled the redeemers in a pincer-like formation and begun the assault. The Redeemers were split into three forces:\n\n\u2022\tThe force on the left was lead by a brutal Redeemer Captain wielding a devastating shotgun that fired ionized crystals, both shredding and zapping his opponents.\n\u2022\tThe force in the centre was lead by cold and calculating Redeemer Captain wielding a mind-tearing psyonic sniper rifle.\n\u2022\tThe force on the right, guarded by a river and only accessible from the centre, was lead by the Redeemer commander himself. He rode a bulky terror-inducing chopper, mounted with a powerful repulse based weapon and an arc blaster, both able to tear apart a full unit in one or two volleys single handily. \n\n\nThe first objective of the bulk of the Amazonian forces was to reach the centre, much easier said than done as many of the routes were thick with rock and overgrowth in the wild terrain. Yet many of the hunters used this to their advantage as a useful cover to shield them from the sniper fire of both the central captain and his entourage of snipers. A hole was made in their defences of flesh and metal by the Amazonian purifiers, hailing firebombs onto the clustered Redeemer defenders. Due to Regata\u2019s wise decision in equipping her hunters with thermal-based targeting on their weapons, the fire aided wonderfully in helping the hunters mow down half the immolated defenders of the central pass at once. With the window of opportunity opened, the raptor cavalry charged in and quickly dealt with the sniping captain, needless to say he never got another shot off.\n\nRegata\u2019s personal force was separated off from the rest to ensure that the redeemers on the left would not flank the rest of her forces heading through the centre and towards the commander; while she stealthily skulked her way around the side of a rocky hill, her hunters made their way up the hill to rain a hail of arrows upon the remaining captain\u2019s forces. Unfortunately, those forces were a lot more powerful than expected and returned fire with brutal repeating arc guns, mowing down a majority of Regata\u2019s personal guard upon the hill and forcing the remnants to retreat back down. Yet the hunters did indeed wipe out the bulk of his forces as they made their way up the hill, leaving the captain with a single weary unit of scavengers.\n\nRegata had enough of watching her loyal soldiers die; with a burst of flame she leapt up onto the hill, directly down upon the scavengers, burning them alive through the power of cinematic entrance alone. Normal people would need to take a moment to recollect themselves after such a move, but due to Regata\u2019s extensive training and aptitude in ruthless killing, the death of the measly scavengers kept her going with the same fire that burned all around her. She charged forward to battle the captain alone, laser glaive versus crystalline shotgun.\n\nEven with such a brutal weapon, the cyborg didn\u2019t have much of a chance; the powerful swings of the warlord\u2019s weapon continued to knock him off balance as the thermal damage seared across his body. In a rage fuelled act of defiance he aimed not at her, but at the last surviving unit of her forces. In a flash of cyan lightning they too joined their sisters in the dirt. Regata took exception to that display, running her glaive so deep into the captain she could have pinned him to the floor. Not that he was any position to need pinning; he was dead the moment the thermal blade pierced his chest, the rest was just for Regata\u2019s personal satisfaction.\n\nThe second captain\u2019s death signalled the battle turning in the Amazon\u2019s favour, Regata could see from the windswept hill her forces converging on the Commander\u2019s personal forces; hunter, raptor and purifier alike. In a fiery display of arrows, lasers and plasma his forces were quickly put down, leaving the Commander to defiantly fight for his life. In the last few moments his deadly chopper put down unit after unit of hunters before he was cornered by the cavalry, piercing his infernal machine with their glaives until it exploded from underneath him. Before the cavalry could land the killing blow he activated his personal escape teleported and fled the scene. Regata, even if she may not have deserved it, had won this brutal battle. \n\nCasualty reports were much better than expected to boot, while both forces started out evenly matched, Regata only lost about a third of her forces while the Redeemers lost the entirety. Of course, this dramatic battle was exactly the kind of fun she was looking for, but she obviously wasn\u2019t done. The redeemer cities were now undefended after all, might as well twist the humiliating dagger until it festers.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10/10, Would have dramatic one on one duel with shotgun wielding borg on a hill again.\n", "timestamp_created": 1565750789, "timestamp_updated": 1565750789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54607081": {"recommendationid": "54607081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144419785", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 1255, "last_played": 1618552812}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game I mostly played Civ for these type of games so this is really refreshing to play.", "timestamp_created": 1565748311, "timestamp_updated": 1565748311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54606735": {"recommendationid": "54606735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007284766", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 12185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1436, "last_played": 1607889299}, "language": "english", "review": "Terrible company.

released.\nWhen Triumph pitched the idea of age of wonders sci fi set in space. the posabilities are endless but what we recieved has been nothing more then a boring and bland copy pasted age of wonders 3\n\nStarting with the races you are able to play as.\nof which 4 are humans. 1 is a dwarf and the other space bugs imagine district 9. for those who have seen that movie.\nno i dont consider tech zombies to be a unique thing. they are still humanoid enough.\nI had hoped and wanted unique species of aliens. races and creatures that could make the universe lively. insanely cool if ya ape a bit of Galactic civilizations for example.\nInstead we are left with just boring humans.\n\npoor graphics, animations and sound.\nwhile some wish to praise how good the game looks at times. i believe the striking look of age of wonders 3 was very unique in a sense. it looked great on so many aspects. \nwhere Planetfall instead falls flat on its face, is from the washed out colours of the overworld to the mind nummingly boring tech tree thats as dull to look at as a spreadsheet. \nthe animations are painfully slow which forces the quicker pace of combat which only makes the animations look dumb.\nvoice acting overall seems to be rather poor. though these only happen in cutscenes between missions you wont hear much of this during actual gameplay.\n\nGameplay and mechanics.\nthere have been some changes from AoW3 to Planetfall. most noticably the sectors instead of previously natural growing cities.\nthough this changes some of the strategy around it quickly becomes a land grab of desperation. before you could precisely place the cities on locations you once desired. now you are to map out the area to find which sectors are to your liking or simply mass produce colonizers.\nthe overal tactical combat has not changed much. though with more ranged firepower avalible they now have a cover system to diversify the engagements. \nspells have now been changed to strategic opperations which do about as well as you can imagine.\nsome devastate the entire enemy army while others wont see any use. \n \nSpecies, Units and Tech.\nThe species as noted above are extremely bland. most units work and act pretty much the same for every race you play.\nyou have your shooty boys, your support boys, your fliers and your ships. all conviently located on the same spot in the tech tree.\nwith tier 1 units mainly being your simple fodder which thankfully can go a long way in every match. but get easily outmatched by anything of tier 3 and above. the major improvement with units is that you can now costumize your units with unlockable modifications. changing attributes to giving abilities. this works with the basic soldier to the final tier units you are able to unlock.\nThe tech tree is your boring spread sheet. with having 2 pages to work with to upgrade your empire.\nThe first is the military tech, this extends to units and modification. to strategic opperations and tactical opperations.\nthe second is your society. which upgrades your empire and unlocks more means to improve your existing colonies. imagine civilizaions. with now being forced into the same upgrade paths consistantly you will most likely spend every start of the match working towards the same techs. since every species shares the same society tech tree only the slight difrence being your specialization of your race.\n\nWell look at me rambling on.\nTo cut the story simple.\nPlanetfall is extremely boring and lacks character to emerge yourself into its gameplay.\none more turn is not a factor unlike its predisessor. \n", "timestamp_created": 1565716378, "timestamp_updated": 1565716378, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score":

There is a lot of work yet to finish this game.  The scenario game I am currently playing (small , 2 players, easy mode, turn off all the extra pickups, etc.) to test the AI and learn the game, is not going so well.  The options I picks seen to make no difference to the map pickups and bonus options, so the map is very cluttered (AOW3 had much better options to minimize neutral armies and get rid of clutter on map).  I tried my 3rd map and still not removing all the clutter, apparently the options with \"None\" as selection really means many.  The game goes fine at first, but the happiness of my cities is taking up so much resources that I can't build but 2 armies, actually have 5 heroes but not enough troops to fill their ranks - since my people keep uprising... but my resources balance looks good, even built them some happy building but does not seem to help (serious issue with game).  Now the real problem , the AI is cheating so badly, I watch one army turn to 6 units instantly and tracked another  army of 2 break in half and then both become 6 with strong units, then made a straight line to my capital city and destroyed it!  You can catch it cheating so easily, I pick their army,  it shows you the number of units and total strength, then as gets closer it is full again with 6 units (even after I attacked from air over and over, troops just instantly arrive). The enemy already at early mid game owns most of the map, no chance at this point to win - then game is over ... was not really that fun to play since many of the smaller battles are just exactly the same (very repetitive).  I have been waiting for this game for a year now since I like AOW3 so much , but greatly disappointed in game so far.  So tired of fighting the local bugs over and over and over again, please allow us to turn it off so can focus on the real enemies.  I can see how this would be a good multi-player game with no AI to cheat, but for single players a big step backwards.

High off of the amazing awesomeness of AoW3 which remains, sadly, the high water mark of the series, most things about the presentation of Planetfall are excellent. The graphics and art design would feel right at home in Endless Legend, and the music is as usual by Michiel van den Bos who is an absolute soundtrack LEGEND.\n\nThe core mechanics aren't fundamentally bad either, though they're a step back from AoW3. Primarily they [i]are[/i] AoW3's mechanics in the combat section, except they decided to reintroduce missing, which adds a stupid random element to the combat. AoW3 did it better by just having cover and range straight reduce ability effects/damage by a percentage. It also just feels less satisfying than AoW3's combat, in part I think because of all the ranged units. Having mostly melee units in AoW3 made combat feel very much like solving a complex puzzle, and sometimes you could tease out AMAZING victories or K:D ratios just from very clever placement and spell use, but PF seems to allow for less of that.\n\nThe strategic map is more or less looted straight from Endless Legend, which isn't fundamentally bad, but suffers from the same issues that EL did, which is that a map of any real size just becomes more of a hassle than fun to work with. Everything about the UI just seems to fight the player by hiding info, often in un-necessary submenus(why do cities need a submenu that you will access at max a total of 4 times in a given city's lifetime? Just fold the Sector submenu in with the others or, better yet, give cities no submenus and just one big screen), and popping up dozens of un-necessary popups.\n\nAnd the strategic play just feels like it's... a bit slower than it has to be. Armies move slow enough to be annoying, construction is slow enough to be annoying, turns tick over slowly enough to be annoying. When I'm already whapping \"autofight\" rather than playing it out twenty turns into the first mission just to speed things up, you know you've got a problem.\n\nMostly what made me drop AoW:PF early in its lifetime was the campaign. \n\nFirstly, the writing is... somehow worse than in the other AoW games where it already wasn't stellar. It feels very much written by someone ESL and then machine-translated to English at points. Lots of unnatural phrasing.\n\nSecondly, rather than being compact and themed, each campaign map is basically what you'd use for a multiplayer game or randomly generate for a skirmish which means lots of retreading the same teching-up ground each game, every map having like five goddamn different factions around and three or four different win conditions. Sometimes half of them resolve themselves even before you can reach them as two factions randomly decide to fight it out. In the first mission I had one friendly faction kill one hostile faction super early, starting off a bunch of scripts, like one of my commanders randomly dying/vanishing, with attached text that made no sense since I hadn't reached any of the lead-in scripts.\n\nIn the second mission, before I could actually complete any of the objectives I was thinking of aiming for, I had more or less by chance befriended and allied the two factions I needed to complete the diplomatic victory. I would have had to actively stay away from them to not complete them like 100 turns before any of the other victory conditions were feasible.\n\nGenerally it feels like this game was never run past any actual testers outside of the development team in its beta phase.\n\nAnd therefore, in good conscience I can't say that anyone should buy this game.\n\nDo get the soundtrack, though, it slaps.", "timestamp_created": 1565645892, "timestamp_updated": 1565645892, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.67114943265914917", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54588841": {"recommendationid": "54588841", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972438669", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1101, "last_played": 1606234886}, "language": "english", "review": "A 4x game that tries to shake up the formula by simplifying the building aspect and focusing more on the combat and tactical gameplay. Storywise, a giant space empire has collapsed and you as a commander of a species/branch of human organization comes out of a long space nap to claim/destroy/set order to a world in chaos. \n\nThe game is very similar to Endless legend having the same city layout (fixed areas), similar resources and an own hex based combat minigame with the units of your armies while you fight. City buildings are a bit more limited and are constrained by the surrounding sectors that you can add to you cities. There are strategic \"abilities\" that you can apply both on the main map, but also during combat which share the same resources. These allow for some specialization and adaptation of strategies to meet the challenges that might occur in the game. \nYou can customize your species, the commander and also which extra technology they have access to outside of their species specific tech. The species themselves have unique units, technology and playstyles.\n\nThe thing that stand out in this game is the combat where they have grabbed the cover/overwatch mechanics from the x-com series. The unit customization is also quite interesting and easy to manage.  \n\nI love 4x games and this game tics of a lot of boxes for me for what makes a good one, but for some reason the game comes off as bland. It is mostly due to the graphics and feel of the game on the main map. Everything seems to blend in to well and nothing stands out here. The story of the game (which i usually don't care about in these games) also suffers from the same fault. It seems to \"try\" very hard, but comes off as disingenuine.

It has a great mix of components similar to Civ, AOW (of course), and other 4x titles, but due to the complexity you cannot just play the same favorite tactic that you have become accustomed to play over and over. \n\nI get this: In Civ I love to keep tensions down and grow, pick off a weak faction or two, then go in for the kill near the end. That tactic always works in civs.\n\nThis game stretches you, in a good way. There are so many facets that both you and the enemy factions have available that you have to think tactically most every turn. React to the world as it changes.\n\nI haven't yet played multiplayer, But it has a good selection of varied scenarios. It also has a very large campaign that I am still working through (and enjoying every minute!). The storytelling is excellent for this genre.\n\nIt has full and partially voiced tutorials and so far all of the research options have are voiced with interesting characterization (ala Civ) and all this builds an excellent atmosphere that has \"life\" to it.\n\nThe tactical combat has been covered well in many reviews. It's great. And while many/most 4x games are lacking on unit and faction variety at launch (saving this often for paid DLC), Planetfall starts out with significant variety. \n\nAs it launched it is a complete game and I appreciate that!\n\nOf course there are areas that can be expanded and I would welcome further what this title has to offer.\n\nAs for any bugs: It just came out so I would not be surprised: But I cannot attest to those as I have not hit a single bug so far. It's early so I expect we will see patches coming to fix those that are out there. But overall the condition of Planetfall seems much more finished than many titles I have purchased in recent years.\n\nHope this helps. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1565639195, "timestamp_updated": 1565639195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527430832386016846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54587275": {"recommendationid": "54587275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042402046", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 975, "last_played": 1603572799}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was an awesome combo of Civ and Xcom.

Even though I personally don't like the flanking mechanic. Well, you get used to it.\n\nAll in all, it is a good 4x game, that could benefit from some polish ESPECIALLY in the controls (no range preview when mouse-overing ability buttons, no unit move preview in combat, easy missclicks, hard to tell what cover blocks line of sight, and what can be shot over, weird right-mouse button scheme and things like that).\nIt means you have to play really carefully with your clicks and be precise when clicking. Making sure you are on target and don't select e.g. a flying unit that's in the way of a ground unit you want to select. Also, I cannot count the times I have accidentally moved a unit next to the enemy instead of attacking it.\n\nThat aside, from the game-play and content side, the game offers a HUGE amount of stuff.

Everyone is praising this game as if it is some new wonderful masterpiece of 4x. There are so many issues it is mind boggling.\n\nThe terribad UI. Why does everything have so many unnecessary clicks? Finished doing everything possible with a unit? Need to click a check mark. Dont want to produce an Operation at the moment, don't worry we will prompt you to do so every few turns. Want some additional explanation of game systems? We are going to force you to click through four tabs of it instead of one quick summary. Not to mention that no animation is clickable, you HAVE to click the hex itself.\n\nCombat, omfg combat. There is NO balance. Certain factions, due to weapon types will wipe the floor with others 9/10 times until mid game techs. Only 6 armies per stack, which basically means unless you keep your heroes in a gang if someone has higher tech than you it is auto lose every war. Moving from cover to cover is practically useless, as the lost movement essentially means they get an extra round of firing. Too many units focus on powerful ranged attacks for any melee to be of real use. When someone can fire 12 hexes away with 20 damage my 24 melee is not a balance trade off even though they are the same tier. Weapon effects mid game turn the tide to the point that if the RNG gods bless you then you auto win from there on out.\n\nBuilding your Empire gives little feedback. Build a district, they all look identical. Annex a wonder, it is identical to the one in your other city. Everything is completely cookie cutter with the only variation being a turn counter or clockwise. The terrain is confusing because you will have desert, alien forests, earthlike forests, mountains and rivers all crammed into an area with abrupt borders, no realistic melding. \n\nI have many more complaints but I will stop here. All in all I was very disappointed with the game because the hype got me caught up and the premise is really cool.

If you played Endless legends and Xcom you will be 90% prepared for this game. This game is literally like both games slammed together. Overworld and Combat\n\nLet me explain.   Like endless legends/civ/anygamelikethose you got your overworld map that has its colored resources: yellow -gold/dust/energy, Green - Food/growth, Orange - production. Purple - science, teal -  influence, blue - secondary resource. Instead of each hex giving a resource this game has clumped a large bunch of hexes into sectors. When your city grows you claimed a new sector. There are still anomolies on sectors that give special stuff. The other difference is doctrines which is basically a factionwide buff or alteration ex. all cities get +15 food. There are even two research trees that you do simultaneously. Overworld and Combat. It's good it works.\n\nThen there is combat which in games like endless legends and civ just plain suck. In this game you and your units are placed on a map with full vision then battle it out Xcom style using cover, height advantage, flanking, destructable environments, accuracy, works. Identical to Xcom. Each unit and commander's loadout has 3 mod slots for a host of added effects. Ammo types, grenades, teleporters, med kits. Xcom vets will question with full vision doesnt it just become an overwatch fest? In truth, some of the time. Depends on the fielded units such as a unit that can spawn drones constantly. Doctrines also play a part in this allowing to drop a med station or air strike. Its great.

You can see there was a great effort to create a new lore, environments and sci-fi assets. It really shines in the campaign map which feels like a lot of fun to explore and discover. All the units feel unique and meaningful with their strengths and weaknesses as well as customization. Unfortunately that's the only mayor new feature, unit customization. \n\nI feel the game is lacking content in the battlefields, though. As in previous games, you seem to just fight in the same generic battlefields over and over regardless of your location on the map. I don't understand why they were able to develop a self generating campaign map, with all the complexities of balancing multiple factions and settlements for fairness, but they can't do anything to add variety to the comparable small battle maps. the maps do change as you go into different terrain, but I made the mistake of generating a Frontier planet and ended up fighting in the same type of terrain for hundreds of turns. The good thing, is that they can fix this with DLC and (hopefully) modding from the community to add flavor to the battles. Besides units, however. Battles are unique for the units you bring. Rarely will you see the same armies fight each other more than twice. \n\n------DISCLAIMER: The following section may offend some people. If waifus is a sensitive subject for you, please don't read what follows-----------------------------------------------------------------\nI must admit I was strongly disappointed by the androgynous female character design. It really shows they put a great effort to ensure it's not possible to create a slim young-looking female character. I really feel the art is misleading on how the amazons look like , even though it's still my favorite faction. (if you keep the camera zoomed out it doesn't show just how burly they are, and since they have the same feminine voice from the Blood Bowl II amazons, it's fine) I know it's 2019, but then they should have woman-it-up and put the muscular Amazon on a commanding pose so you know what you are getting. But that's a minor issue, though. The only real difference is that in AoW 3, when I open the diplomacy I say \"ow, my Queen of beauty and power, I stand at your feet\", now I get emasculated and say \"oh right, the BOSS woman!

It offers a depth of gameplay and tactical satisfaction rarely found in other titles.  The game's steep learning curve may be off putting to some, but if you put in the time to learn the systems and be okay with failure while learning the depth the game offers is well worth the work to learn.\n\nThis is an absolute must play for fans of 4x titles such as Civilization or for tactical fans from the XCOM crowd.  \n\n\n\nThe game is a perfect blend of grand strategy and tactical battles. It can have a bit of a steep learning curve for the uninitiated but the complexity allows the game to be deep enough to hold your interest over the long term.  THe game will require you to be invested in learning its systems to really feel like you know whats going on.  If you want a quick, easy to pick up strategy game, this might not be for you.\n\nGraphically the game is gorgeous.  The units look amazing and the XCOM style battles are my favorite part of the game. \n\nThe sheer amount of combinations you can create to be used in tactical combat is staggering.  Between Your race, which secret tech you choose (basically the equivalent of your school of magic in previous age of wonders titles) the equipment and talents your heros employ or the mods you equip to your units, as well as the combination of units you put in your armies leaves a nearly endless array of strategies to try out. Not to mention combo's of support units damage moves (ranged vs melee) buffs, debuffs, and control abilites to play with.   The 3 action system which allows heavy hiting attacks or abilites to stagger their oppents which removes one action from the defending unit on their next turn makes for a great tactical battle that is far more than the usual rock, paper, scissors systems many strategy games give us.\n\nWithout fail it seems every 4x game's detractors complain that \"Diplomacy is bad\"  I see this as a recurring complaint in the negative reviews but I often wonder what people who always seem to complain about \"Bad Diplomacy\" are expecting.  The game gives you the ability perform covert operations as well as detect them.  Should you detect such actions you can choose to privately warn the empire at fault or publicly denounce them.  This same warning/denouncing feature is available for each instance of offence the empire has committed against you, from covert operations, to being friendly with your enemies, or disrespecting your claims.  You can also compliment the AI for things they do if you're looking for better relations.  It has the typical trading and deals systems you would expect.  \n\nYou can earn Casus Belli against an empire so that declaring war on them is considered justified by your neighbors so that they wont view you as a war monger.  The game even allows you to trade away your Casus Belli with the empire as an act of good faith where you no longer have a justified cause for war in exchange for something else.\n\nI honestly dont know what all these \"Diplomacy is terrible\" rants are all on about because the diplomacy feels pretty robust.  I feel like these sorts of people wont be satisfied until AI is able to fool them into thinking they are having a real conversation with someone.  Though some variety in the actual wording of responses could go a long way in helping with immersion, I dont feel like the lack of that takes away from the things you are actually able to do in the diplomacy system.  Remember you're playing a turn based strategy game, not speaking with a semi-sentient chat bot. The goal is to accomplish your strategic objects via diplomacy, not have a fulfilling conversation with Skynet. And as far as actual objectives are concerned the diplomacy system really does let you accomplish a lot.\n\nAs far as bugs are concerned I have yet to run into any, but I've seen reports of several so if you have an older system you might want to wait on this title until you've upgraded your PC because from the reports I've read it seems the game doesn't play well with older graphics cards or processors.\n\nAll in all the game is probably the best turned based 4x game available right now, and if I'm wrong about that than its certainly the best turn based 4x game in a Sci-Fi setting.  So I wholeheartedly recommend buying this game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1565548341, "timestamp_updated": 1565548341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.377081990242004395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54571080": {"recommendationid": "54571080", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974872538", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 433, "last_played": 1584504858}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, very similar to AOW3 but better IMO.", "timestamp_created": 1565547340, "timestamp_updated": 1565547340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54570581": {"recommendationid": "54570581", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995763660", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 457, "last_played": 1566057118}, "language": "english", "review": "Nothing new, nothing fresh, nothing good.", "timestamp_created": 1565545211, "timestamp_updated": 1587766646, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.215251892805099487", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54570078": {"recommendationid": "54570078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022142121", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1565552765}, "language": "english", "review": "The game seems very nice at first, but I can't recommend it.\n\nThe game is very buggy, our save got ruined because it got stuck in an endless loop of \"Waiting for manual combat\" even when there was none.

Unit diversity and also counters are more prominent here as even low tiered units can be powerful due to their support skills or counters and with higher exp ranks. \n\nEspecially with addition of mods, you can customize individual units with additional stats or skills that can provide low tier units with more utility, fullfill roles and counters unavailable to your race. The correct combinations between unit abilities and mods can make or break a battle encounter. Synergy is of utmost importance. You can turn the weakest tier 1 unit into an unstoppable cheap slave force or convert a useless sniper into a mobile teleporting healer. Unit mods are a welcomed addition, i hope it gets expanded on in the future.\n\nAll in all, tactical combat follows X-com style rather than traditional turn based. Dynamic and needs some planning with more focus on unit skills, combos, overwatch and such. AoW3 used to have toned down RNG, basically your RNG is in dmg range and saving throws but in Planetfall, its back to the classic RNG heavy mechanics where you also have to roll for chance to hit. Good and bad, i'm on the fence for this one. Furthermore they've added another layer in the form of terrain, more focus on cover system and terrain hazards, taking cover behind volatile crystals or fuel barrels is not really a good idea. Also little changes like to elevation, certain units(like tanks) on a slope or at the base of a cliff cannot directly hit units above it.\n\nTop tier units like tier 4 are no longer spammable unlike in AoW3, due to costs of said units and its mods and especially upkeep tied to certain scarce resource. In general, smaller armies too as resource production is lower than in AoW3, you wont be able to field too many army stacks. Game encourages retaining units by ranking them up and investing in mods.\n\nHeroes have also been buffed a lot, they are now better at their roles(support, offense etc), usually stronger than even modded units or elites and can be a game changer. Overall they are more useful and play a crucial role.\n\nReally dig the new theme and lore, devs nailed it jumping to the sci-fi setting. Russian dwarf is epic. Cant wait for new races and classes.\n\nDon't like the new sectors system, trying to copy the classic strategic map system like Civ. Unnecessarily complicated but at the same time feels dumbed down. Also feels too restrictive. Needs to be more fleshed out. I prefer area of Influence system in AoW3, more freedom to build your empire and also ability to build roads and outposts(to project influence to grab special resources) have been removed too.\n\nGame UI lacks info. AoW3 did an awesome job, info is easily accessible and everything is transparent.\n\nAoW3 has a much more rich and dense content for their races and classes, including the research and spells, units, skills and the likes. Planetfall kinda falls behind, their tech tree is smaller and compact, kinda repetitive though it does not have the RNG like in AoW3. Also goes the same for the minor factions, neutrals, critters and their units, could use a bigger pool. It can be argued that mods mechanic makes up for it but i really hope for more. Then theres stuff like the removal of the mercenary for hire system etc.\n\nDue to new sector system and removal of underworld layer, game map is much more smaller than in AoW3 even on enormous size setting. Consequently lesser stuff to explore, i find myself lacking dungeons to clear on Planetfall compared to AoW3 even with equivalent settings. \n\nI liked the underworld layer in AoW3, more playstyle options and adds another strategic layer. Wasted opportunity, devs could have created a Void/Immaterium layer(like in WH40k), moreover the \"Void\" realm is kinda talked about a lot in Planetfall lore. Would be so cool to have a Void layer with their own unique inhabitants & features...\n\nEarly and mid game is really slow. Again due to new sector system in strategic map and short tech trees that have overly inflated research times. And the reduced map size that leaves you with limited exploration opportunities.\n\nI can see balance will be a forever ongoing issue, especially when it comes to multiplayer. Mostly due to the mods mechanics. Can already see huge disparity with certain builds seemingly overpowered. Then again most are due to late game mods and in competitive play, unlikely to go beyond mid game.\n\nGfx & art is spectacular but they overdid it. Hurts my eyes, colors are too loud and theres too many details. Detailed is good, but too many stuff going on kills it. Like in the tactical and strategic map, you got too many assets and colors strewn across, makes locating units, landmarks, buildings a challenge, very distracting. \n\nCampaign is lackluster and short lived. Needs more missions and better story telling. To be honest AoW3 did not fare well either in this regard. Planetfall has potential in terms of lore, devs need to exploit this!\n\nPlanetfall compared to AoW3, 2 steps forward, then 2 steps back. Cons negates all the pros.

Oh, my, gosh, those first few missions were gouge-my-eyes-out boring.  Ooooo, marines with space lasers that shoot other marines with space lasers, weeeeee...  The missions absolutely did not put Planetfall's best foot forward, and this was exacerbated by the fact that they took way too long.  I seriously considered returning the game, I was having so little fun.  It was only my love of Age of Wonders 3 that kept me going, along with my recollection of how much I enjoyed the free-play of that game.\n\nAnd then it clicked. \n\nOnce you are out of the oppressive mirror matches with low tier Vanguard units, Planetfall is a veritable supernova of cool unit types, fun abilities, and absolutely awesome tactical maps.  There's Different weapon types, melee and ranged strikes, attack strengths, defense powers (the standard \"hunker down\" is for some units \"deploy force field in a 3 tile radius\").  There are all kinds of different support abilities.  There's flying and ground units for (I think) all factions.  The heroes are fairly customizeable.  \n\nAll of this variety is exemplified by the mod system.  Each unit can hold up to three mods, from your commander to your grunts to your best unit ever.  Being able to upgrade tier 1 units as you progress is pure genius, as it enables the fun aspects of the gameplay and allows you to focus on combat with minimal ferrying back and forth.  This is made all the better by the decision to have every mod give a baseline armor, shield, or damage upgrade.  No longer are you pondering whether you should take the straight damage upgrade or the bleed effect, or whether you should grab the health or the healing ability; you get both inherently!  It really pushes the ability-focused design in a way that I love.  Abilities should not be \"me get stronger hit you harder.\"  Give me something cool! ... and Planetfall did. \n\nBack to the tactical map design really quickly.  I swear, I have not seen a repeat map yet.  Sure, they all fall into the basic category of \"cover here, routes there,\" but I've played over 50 battles (thank you, annoying Steam achievement pop-up) and each battle has seemed incredibly fresh.  There are elevation differences, explosive terrain, city-scapes, forest battles, battles with void barriers...  It's been awesome.  Oh, and Age of Wonders rather annoying \"the independents get a powerful ability at every site\" has been reworked to allow you fight a battle before the battle to turn it off.  Great move!  \n\nBottom line: Planetfall is a tactical turn-based masterpiece.  \n\nOf course, this is tacked on to the solid if fairly benign 4X overworld map.  To Planetfall's credit, I spend 80% of my time worrying about my armies, only going to my colonies to check on production when necessary.  You can min-max workers if you want, but its not a necessity a-la Stellaris or Civ.  The tech tree is also incredibly meaty - perhaps too much so for some, but as a guy who plays Endless Space, I don't find it nearly as overbearing as those games.  \n\nAt this point, I would highly recommend this game.  For what the developer lacks in their open salvo of storytelling, they more than make up in their gameplay and mechanics.\n\nA quick public service announcement in closing: turn off sector outlines by default and set them to toggle on a hot-key.

Later, they metamorphed into even larger and more fearsome Hopperhound Eviscerators! What was once a pathetic army was now metamorphed, modded up, and a force to be reckoned with! \nSniper Hero lead his forces around the map taking conquests and helping to expand our lands, until war broke out with our neighbours to the east. He led his units on an exploratory expedition into enemy territory, only to quickly realise they were sending multiple stacks of units from all sides and he was severely outnumbered... The only way out was through a teleporter, further into enemy territory! So forwards they went. 3 stacks of forces would eventually catch up to and surround them! Combat ensued. Outnumbered, and apparently outgunned, Kir'ko Sniper Hero and units emerged victorious and unscathed! But the enemy units kept coming. Again and again did they try and evade combat only to get engaged and emerge victorious.

It delivers in this area, but it does so at the expense of other gameplay mechanics, mainly strategic map macro management  - which you might be looking for in a \"4X\" title. \n\nYes there is some, it is also not completely meaningless and at least in sufficient multitude to allow several builds optimized for specific purpose to exist...but ultimately all this serves to better prepare for rich tactical combat experience, main focus of this game. \n\nI am a sucker for min-maxing. When I buy new strategic game I spent a lot of time restarting the game and experimenting with various starting builds and available options (because Byzantines ARE going to beat Ottomans in EUIV after \"couple\" of attempts :P). It was not obvious at the beginning and the game tutorial does not exactly help explaining how things work, but I have found plethora of efficient and completely different combinations, which led to rich and refreshing (combat-focused) gameplay experience - because yay, more options!\n\nI have seend multiple reviewers complain about bland and unified tech-tree and I really had to giggle pretty hard, because this game have pretty bog standard (in unexciting) approach to teching. In turn-based/realtime-pause games you have usually two main ways how to approach tech tree. You either have completely different tech tree for each faction, but there are next to zero modification options for the actual units (Total War Warhammer, Heroes of M+M) OR you have similiar tech tree for every faction, but you have plethora of modification options for individual units (Stellaris, Endless Franchise). Because the depth is never present in first pick of hundred different options, but in subsequent of combinations of said options. You may have similiar tech for every faction - but those factions have units with different abilities and damage channels, so combinations of mentionned tech are completely different for them.\n\nOr did you not know, that you can take synth +crit mod, then do Paragon quest line, take their mod for +crit, then take mod that increases range, then put it on a ranged unit with repeatable attacks, and because crit procs and the first attack and then applies for all attack of that unit, you will crit with every shot in your full attack, even if you base chance to hit was low, if you manage to roll crit, you will obliterate superior enemy units at max range. Naturally you also had your strategic dmg buff active and then you also activated your tactical dmg buff (if you stack everything as mentionned you will be surprised what can sniper hero one-shot), right?\n\nOr did you not know, that you can take your faction-generic laser unit, give it mod which reduces resistance to burning attacks (basically dungeons and dragons DC vs saving throw),then combine it with promethean tech specific units and wreak havoc on enemy frontline.  Enemy elite unit with high dmg reduction? Nope, melted in one turn. This work also for other damage channels and can be used to reduce enemy defenses to apply status effects (debuffs).You have naturally chosen laser unit with repeatable attacks, so you get more procs at defense reduction right? You can for example rush tank \"mount\" for your vanguard hero for this purpose - choose veteran trait, get lvl 8 asap to pick advanced driving, have tank researched in military tech (does not take too long) - you do not need to build tank building, hero can equip it immediately.\n\nOr did you not know, that you can combine smoke with psynumbra accuracy reduction aura and rush enemy frontline to render their unit worthless? You did also apply tactical accuracy reduction from psynumbra operation on said unit because it stacks, right? Or perhaps you used other obscured enabler like nanite tactical operation with obscure aura? You also used close combat hero with martial tradition to get in the middle of enemy frontline unschathed right? Trick is to run with said hero until you have your last action remaining, then use your ranged units to soften closest enemy, then you finish him with your secondary ranged attack on your hero - ta daa, action points refunded thx to martial traditions, stack up debuff auras and run into middle of their units and start carnage.\n\nJust a couple of pointers, so you have easier exploration at the beginning if you choose to delve into this game.

I love the ability to mod my units, and I like the extra customization options for heroes. \n\nNow the bad. Adding more complexity to a system that was more-or-less perfect as is, is always a hit and miss. Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't. In this case, I could do without the annexation of regions and the faction demands, and how each faction works against each other, is a bit ridiculous.\n\nSecond, some major balance changes need to be observed. I am always running out of cosmite and there isnt enough supply to go around. It takes 105 cosmite to build units that can take out other units of ai factions, which is a bit... frustrating as it seems like the ai doesn't need it for their units.\n\nI also went up against a small ai army of 5 heroes with a total of 2.3k combat power, with my total combined power being 12k... and lost? WTF?!\n\nThe game keeps saying I have research to complete, but I checked everywhere and there are no more things to research. Civics tech has absolutely nothing more, but the icon for selecting more research will simply not go away.

(i.e : the automatons - robots who specialize in lazer damage types, with a mod to purchase to melt armor, and an empire wide buff)\n\n** do note however it is impossible i think to get to max relations with all factions, due to the major fact that they all hate each other\n\n7) on a final note, hero options are back and better than ever, hero army buffs now provide more utility and upgrades, their weapons give more options and now vehicles are a CONSUMABLE ( in a sense) that if a hero dies while in a vehicle, they respawn instantly at low health but lose the vehicle\n\noverall , get now if you got nothing better to play but wait for a sale to get more aliens :4\n", "timestamp_created": 1565458985, "timestamp_updated": 1565458985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560887813568115234", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54553367": {"recommendationid": "54553367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013350670", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2765, "last_played": 1606250148}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

This is a VERY different game, but I love what they have done with it.\n\nThe freedom you have with customizing your units goes beyond changing their attack or defence stats. You are able to change in-combat abilities, damage types, single target/AOE attacks, and more. The one thing the game does not allow you to change is the default weapon of normal units, but the damage amount, damage type, weapon range, and other factors can be altered with mods. This effectively leaves you with a different weapon (IMHO) even if you can't \"actually\" change it. An example of this would be attaching an incindiary ammo mod to a unit with a machine gun, changing the damage type and giving an AoE attack instead of a single unit attack. This limitation does not apply to hero units, which are able to use any weapon you choose, including vehicles like tanks or pterodactyl looking animals with (queue Dr. Evil's voice) frickin laser beams on their heads.\n\nONE WORD OF WARNING: I started this game with a fair bit of knowledge of Civ, AoW3, Xcom, and Endless Legends. If you do not have experience with some of these games, the amount of information thrown at you (without explanation) can be daunting. That being said, I have always found a steep learning curve generally leads to a game you can enjoy for quite a long time. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1565455431, "timestamp_updated": 1565455431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691571891307830811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54552449": {"recommendationid": "54552449", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962699019", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1565401204}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't bother buying this game until they work out the bugs.

As a fan of the particular games AoW3, Stellaris and CK2 I WANT to be able to recommend this game; however, the step backwards/lack of content on this and the lack of content in Imperator: Rome seems to be indicative of a new basic premise at Paradox as a publisher.  That being charge full price for a shell of a game and then charge $20 a pop to add basic features/content.  I'm sorry but in this day and age of disruption yes people expect your NEXT game in a series to have almost all of the content/features of the previous one post DLC, not half as much as on the previous one's release.  Let's look at some specific issues I have:\n\n1.  No real variation in how any of the races play.\n     Every race here plays essentially the same.  There are no interesting or unique mechanics that make any of the races stand out.  The Kir'Ko play identical to the Vanguard who play identical to the Amazons, which play no different than the Assembly.  Oh don't get me wrong there is some minor variations here and there in some of the things they do, such as the Dvar being able to build their own cover in battle, but overall they play identical as evidenced that their research trees are largely the same.\n\n     It would have been nice to have seen something like the Undead in AoW3 that expanded by rebuilding razed towns, or the Total War Warhammer series where each race plays significantly differently with different research, methods to accomplish their goals, etc.  Such is not the case here where a tank is a tank is a tank, and the different races largely spread across the planet in the same way.  All of the variation is purely from a story telling aspect.\n\nand that brings us to a related critique\n\n2.  No real interesting decisions.\n     There is never any point in time where you have to make a choice between A and B that has real extensive repercussions.  Sure there is the occasional 'Wipe out the humans or not, WARNING THIS WILL HAVE LONG TERM EFFECTS' but they really don't none that actually matter.  I get that there are many reasons people play games, but the thing I always liked about 4x and strategy games in general is the interesting decisions that come up, and the stories that those decisions create.  Here unfortunately there is no such decisions and no such story.  It is so bland and bare bones with no real decision making that it is simply not that interesting.\n\n       Don't get me wrong there is a TON of 'content', the research tree is huge but  3/4 of it at any given time is mostly pointless.  There are tons of units, but they are all largely the same and all largely fill the same basic roles with not variation beyond 'archer a bit more powerful, armor but a bit more powerful'.  It all does the same work for the most part, and the customization through mods, while nice, essentially comes down purely to a 'throw the highest tier mod you got on to boost the unit strength and move on' with the functioning of the mods not really making a difference.\n\nAnd that's my 2 cents.  It has promise, but the lack of being able to meet the level of content/completeness of a post DLC game from five years ago, and the complete lack of interesting decisions means I simply can't recommend it.  Perhaps when they've dome some content patches and refined it such as Paradox has done with Stellaris (which I can forgive as it was their first space 4x) I will be able to recommend it but until that happens I say save your money and wait for a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1565447530, "timestamp_updated": 1565447569, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 321, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.802756309509277344", "comment_count": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54551152": {"recommendationid": "54551152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006888073", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1941, "last_played": 1590588944}, "language": "english", "review": "Worthy.", "timestamp_created": 1565446795, "timestamp_updated": 1565446795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.39682537317276001", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54549730": {"recommendationid": "54549730", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963586755", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1565440814}, "language": "english", "review": "Got 48 minutes out of the game before crashing started.

You're constantly assaulted with excessive amounts of information, to the point that it saps the fun out of the game and makes every decision mentally exhausting. And there's no small number of decisions\n\nFor example, completing research is something I constantly dread, because it means I'll have to figure out what to research next.\n\nIn Planetfall, you're faced with at least 4 (often upwards of 8-10) different options, each option containing 2-4 different benefits, each benefit containing a paragraph long description. That's up to 40 different paragraphs of text you need to read and compare. To make matters worse, the UI doesn't allow you to read all of the benefits associated with the option in a single place; instead, you have to mouse over each benefit individually, which makes it even harder to process what you're getting. And there are two parallel research trees, so after finally reading through the 40 paragraphs and deciding which set of benefits you want, you have to do it all over again with a completely different set of options.\n\nThe unit modding system suffers from the same problem. Mods are thrown at you left and right, and each mod comes with a wall of text. You end up in a situation where you're comparing a dozen different walls of text, then repeating the process for each of the three slots, and then repeating that process for each of your different unit types. The end result is that you just start ignoring mods, because you don't want to spend the time and energy figuring out what to equip.\n\nI've logged hundreds of hours in the various Age of Wonders games, but I can't even manage to play a single scenario of Planetfall for more than an hour before losing all interest.", "timestamp_created": 1565413913, "timestamp_updated": 1565414067, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462557703256607056", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54544065": {"recommendationid": "54544065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027889509", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 11295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 833, "playtime_at_review": 523, "last_played": 1619132029}, "language": "english", "review": "Thumbs up.

Between the new 'influence' resource, covert operations, casus belli mechanics and trustworthiness, there's much more game in manipulating the map's diplomatic landscape to suit you than was present in 3.\n\nThe combat and unit depth are where the game especially shines.  AoW3 was poor in this regard - even after updates improved racial diversity, the differences between races were comparitively minor and you broadly played similarly no matter what you were running.  In planetfall, every race plays combat completely differently, with a host of different synergies, advantages and weaknesses - expanded further by secret tech and mod selection.  I get the same kind of satisfaction exploring a certain playstyle in planetfall as I would e.g. playing a different faction in a card game, and that's something 3 never really offered me.\n\nI'm having more fun with the campaign in planetfall.  Three's campaigns were fairly linear, the stories weren't particularly grabby, and I generally had more fun playing random maps.  Planetfall's campaign maps are still random, and let you customize your start, and still manage to tell interesting stories exploring each of the races.  There's a fair bit of choice in how you play out each scenario with regards to how you treat the other factions, making each map much like a normal game, but the flavour response to how you act makes it that much more engaging.  \n\nDownsides?\nGame's not winning any awards for its UI.  It's servicable, and not much more.  Often I'd appreciate having x info visible while making a decision, and there's no way to get to it easily.  Often I'd like to be able to click an NPC faction's emblem to enter diplomacy, and it doesn't.  Some tooltips are just missing from where you'd expect them.  Triumph have shown they're willing to work on the UI in updates, however.\n\nI would've preferred a little more asymmetry on the strategic layer.  Every player scouts the same way, colonizes and annexes the same way, builds 95% the same buildings, has the same covert ops.  All the incredible variation in the combat instantly evaporates once it ends.  I really think there could be more done here.\n\nThe whole AoW format is still an awkward fit in multiplayer.  They've certainly tried, with multiplayer allowing you to seamlessly switch between concurrent multiplayer and native PBEM.  There are 'combat cards' that optionally limit players' use of manual combat.  Nevertheless, if you're playing multiplayer and want to enjoy the manual combat - the game's entire reason to be - in a climactic siege against another player, everyone else is going to have to get up and leave for half an hour.  Perhaps worse, this makes multiplayer a real struggle when players are playing the game or a given race for the first time.  Unless they're allowed to manual combat some trivial AI battles (which will really slow everything down) they'll have no idea how to effectively control their army once the fights start to matter.  If your friends aren't already solid 4X fans who'll be willing to invest hours into playing solo to learn the game, this is going to be a hard sell.

A lot of disclaims are over the name, expactations in general and last not but least paradox DLC politics. Spoiler ahead, the last part is the topic I could agree with most of the players, but seeing the last published games from paradox we are really, forgive the bad wordplay, in an age of wonder.\n\nLets go back to the name of the game. Age of wonders: Planetfall. Please trouble yourself by looking the review section, it really is astonishing how people complain about the setting of a game, which they were able to follow for about 1-2 years. This game makes no secret out of it's setting. It is crazy sci-fi 4X with laser shooting velociraptors (I honestly never thought, that I could write something like this in a serious way *pew pew*. Nevertheless people act surprise and complain about it. Like I said, the game development process was pretty trasparent. Could the game done more? I doubt that.\n\nSecond part, why felt people wronged in their expactation of the game. Captain! Don't look far to the the island of bitterness and sorrow, it is inhabit by people who played (or at least claimed to play) title XY of an other Age of Wonders game. Jokes aside, I see their point, but I rate it diferently. I myself played Age of Wonders III and really really liked it. The Hero Builder was complex enough to sink a lot of hours into just trying to find a stylish combo of class, race and spells. It was cool, no doubt, but was is the benchmark for complexity in an Age of Wonders game? It's up to you. Planetfall made it different in a good way. Instead of hoping for a good bunch of researchable \"Spells\" in your spellbook, they introduced a techtree, less random, more streamlined, better to adjust for the different stages of the game. It is arguably good or bad or both, if you like the middleground. But is it less complex? I don't think so.\n\n You still can costumize your hero in fair lot of ways. The playstile is now more dependent on the pick of the race and the secret tech. They are no gimmics but core elements of the game. This three parts together are still complex. For example: in Age of wonders 3 you got your units out from the rooster of the race in combination with your class. Age of Wonders: Planetfall does this in an analogous way. Now it is race and secret tech, but! Yes there is the big but, they managed to integrate the NPC-factions in a god damn clever way into the unit rooster. You still can conquer them or and here is the kicker, you trade them with influence. (*hust* the influence system on its own is damn genius *hust*). It is fun to build up your relation with the different factions in order to get units, mods, doctrines and map control. Beside that these factions are not just sidekicks anymore, you care for them. I do, I think...\n\nComing to an end (*yaaay*) Age of Wonders: Planetfall is different from it's predessor in many ways. But claiming that it is a dumped down version, like a lot of reviewers did, is just not honest. You don't have to like it, but try to reflect, why you don't like it and if it really is the fault of the game or just personal bias, which could be layed down quite easily.\n\nLadys and Gentelman, thank you for your patience and I hope you also have a blast while playing this game.

Good game, bad content practices.[/H1]\n\nPlanetfall reminds me a lot of Evolve. That's not a good memory to have. Where the game itself is actually very good but because of idiot marketing decisions you never feel like you've quite got the complete game. Evolve had so many possible pre-order versions that it was like trying to navigate the Crystal Maze and figure out which door got you closest to the finished product, and then purchasing the rest of the bits piecemeal.\n\nHere you had a similar problem, bits of cosmetic content locked behind a time limited newsletter, bits of cosmetic content tied to pre-orders, bits of cosmetic content tied to a deluxe version, a planetary scenario (which turns out to be one of the five \"officially listed\" scenarios) locked to the deluxe or top version. So like, [i]really?[/i]. EDIT: The commanders that come as base do not use any DLC cosmetics. I'm not sure about random generated.\n\nThe game itself is good. Not great. But good. I suspect it will be great when Triumph eventually get around to finishing it some three expansions down the line. What we have here is a typical Paradox product. The core is well put together, but it's just that. The Core. This is not the complete experience. We'll get that and when we do it'll be magnificent, but you'll have to pay extra for that.\n\n[H1]Paradox, this has to stop. It's time we talked about this.[/H1]\n\nI get it. Your long term support of games is legendary. But Stellaris was a case in point. When it came out it was a mess, a buggy, confused, chaotic mess. There was a lot of promise and potential under the hood, and it had original ideas (some of which you've murdered on the altar of efficiency), It's become a much more mature and complete game as you've added to it, but once again, the cost of entry and the cost of what you need to make the damn thing what it is now are two very different things. Let's not get into Crusader Kings 2, that thing is a nightmare if you've not been fortunate enough to get the DLC on a sale.\n\nPlanetfall is slated for three expansions, by the end of which I strongly suspect we'll see how the game is supposed to feel like with everything it's supposed to have. Six factions and six secret techs is not exactly a bounty of options, and when you get into the meat of the game those secret techs just feel like different damage types as opposed to anything really ground shaking. Where's the cool tech specific buildings? I get that Age of Wonders games have been predominantly all about the units and making them unique and interesting but given there's been additional focus on making city development more significant with the advent of sectors it feels like one side got significantly more care than the other.\n\n[H1]The way to win feels very defined, and being creative whilst welcomed at the micro level, is punished at the macro.[/H1]\n\nYou end up with a lot of units that overlap each other because your racial and your tech dump a lot of units out and if you want to blend the pair to max your hero potential you'll end up with similar damage paths for both tech and race. There's precious little to really make races stand out except for these ethereal \"doctrines\" which are passive buffs in the main. The real issue is your Commander defines your primary damage path and you're going to want to max that since then you get all the useful benefits from following the tree (so making sure you throw out lots of pyro toting units if you're running a promethean commander).\n\nRunning different *types* of commanders sounds like a good idea until you realise it puts you at a research disadvantage for your doomsday weapon victory path, so taking on non specced commanders means you'll only invest in those at a minimal level.\n\nThis game could have stood to have learned from Endless Legend in some aspects, such as integrating minor races (as opposed to just buying units from their leaders or only being able to integrate from their leading colony), and having more, and more diverse minor races as a result. The city building side is *nearly* there but again, lessons from Endless Legend would have been really helpful.\n\nThe area where Planetfall shines is tactical combat, where once again large scale battles can result in brilliant, drawn out tactical battles, and where individual units can be god damned heroes. AoW 3 before it shined in this regard, and that element hasn't dimmed, you just wish it had learned from other games to get the other small elements right.\n\nAnd you wish Paradox had learned not to make their content model so opaque and unpleasant.\n\n[H1]Closing thoughts[/H1]\n\nIt's good. It's held back from being great from a paucity of content and Paradox once again proving what you get in the box isn't the finished product, and due to the vagaries of pre-orders, various editions and time limited content campaigns, you may not even get everything even if you try.\n\nThe game marches very strongly in combat, but the stuff outside of it feels very much hollow, this was forgivable in AoW 3, it's *less* forgivable now. This is something that I had issues with previously, now it becomes a legitimate complaint. If Triumph decide to make another Age of Wonders, this is now something that -needs addressing-, because the empire management side feels perfunctory and misses elements that would make it feel more viable.\n\nVerdict: [b]Recommend, on discount - How much of a discount depends on you.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1565368492, "timestamp_updated": 1565387050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 345, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892441868782043457", "comment_count": 38, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54535282": {"recommendationid": "54535282", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982804269", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 949, "last_played": 1616872155}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros\nUser Interface feels like a AAA title all the way\nGraphics slightly improved....slightly.\n\nCons\nMusic, turned it off immediately and was like ahhh\nTook a game that had by far the best combat model of any 4x game, setting it apart, and made tweaks that feel off and feels like who is in charge does not get it. (thankfully combat is the same as AoW 1,2,3 tho should have been improved!)\n\nShould have done instead\nFocused on making Race choice count more as the weakest aspect of AoW was always that you start out as one race but can play all the others by making one of your cities each race....\nFocused on making spell books more race specific making the above matter even more\n\nNeed to learn more abouts\nThis Zone thing feels off but not a deal breaker and do not like so far at all the \"spell book\" mechanic, feels bad.\n\nBottom line\nInterface fetched them the 49.99 price tag for a 20 dollar game IMO. I'd pay 30 but...\nFire whomever decided on which tweaks to make overall and higher me to work for free unless I make the right choices as reflected in the sales. My contribution will just be in the planning stage as I love this series and I see it going in the wrong direction as whomever is at the helm seems to want to turn this game into Civ. Please stop and focus on what this game does better than any other on the market...COMBAT, beautiful turn based tactical combat...That is where the majority of money should go next and lose most new changes. Keep the interplanetary stuff as it opens up more options for races.\n\nAoW was always just barely a 4x game...Once I played several other 4x games I realized 4x games are kinda crappy and AoW stuck out because it had the most fun combat.\nI find it hard to believe AoW players want to win by freaking diplomacy....If they do, why are they playing AoW when other games do it better?\nNO! this game is about combat and this zone crap might be okayish eventually , I do not know and frankly do not care.\n\nI already just thought of a great idea and sure I could think of many more, but I am tired of watching companies take great concepts and ruin them. Most gamer's agree as I see the same thing over and over. I could list games and watch people nod.\n\nStop breaking what is not broken and start building on why this game got it's way to a 4th installment.\nIf people like 4x games they have many good choices. AoW was never really truly one of them as who plays this game and thinks this game does anything better than other 4x games aside form combat? NOBODY  ...you, that 1 person, hush, sit back down. Thank you.\n\nReally there are a few things about Planetfall that are improvements....They are little things however and I bet anything you like to bet, that it was a person making less money that made those choices. (Vegetarian, LoL)\n\nThis Zone crap...Man....okay it might be okay, but c'mon man. I am serious, hire me for AoW 4 planning stage and I truly will work for free unless you see results.\nWe went from tunneling cockroaches, which was.....FREAKING AWESOME...to an overly polished...well...I do overall still want to give this game a fair shot...I just \"feel\" the issues. I have been through this too many times.\nSad part is, this version may do the best commercially because new players will likely not know the problems and a fancy interface does matter.\n\nThis is likely going to encourage more bad choices.

I have no bloody clue wtf is going on.  You get an ice map, a light blue colored outline of where your army can move and you can't see squat.  Then what you can see is a huge selection of odd objects I don't know what they do.  This whole game is filled with so many different, and unique ideas it's overwhelming.  This is a game you need to invest 100+ hours to unlock, and I don't feel like it's necessary.\n\nWhat they've done great is provide you with so many races that fight uniquely.  The combat is great!  I've tried all of the armies and they each have a unique flair.  The hero system is good (not great), because I've started to notice if you specialize your heroes you can turn them into demi-gods with the system rewarding specialization over balanced builds.  Then there's the tech tree, wow this is confusing.  6+ hours in and I understand the build that's working, but I don't understand what I'm researching.  It's the same problem as the map, so much information and all these things only apply in very small circumstances... so why is it here?\n\nIt's RPG X-Com with empire building, but the empire building sucks.\n\nIf this game was just basic empire building and the combat I would give it a thumbs up.  Half of this game is awesome, most of it is boring, and I can't give an \"ok\" rating.\n\nps: I wouldn't even ask for a refund, they've put a lot of effort into this, but it's a giant train wreck.\n\n----- 40 hours in recap -----\nDo I like the game?  Yes.  \nWould I recommend it?  No.  \nWhy?  That's complicated... mostly quality of life improvements.  \n\nThere is a huge amount of excess fat in this game, but I don't think the designers want to cut out that fat for fear of losing what makes the game tasty.\n\nProblem 1)  The majority of your fights and tech tree choices are decided not on getting a new gun, but instead putting the right scope on your pistol.  By the time you invest in new technology, and build the structures, and produce it, the game is over.  So upgrades shouldn't be this effective, but they are.  \n\nProblem 2) The map.  Only after the last patch did the game start telling me if an enemy army invaded my territory.  There's also Universal Camouflage (invisibility) which makes it impossible without the proper upgrades (detector) to see certain enemy units on the map.  You aren't even given the info if you've visited special locations, buffs, or Dvar's prospecting.  Running a big empire is tiring, not fun.\n\nProblem 3) AI bugs and cheats.  The campaigns are heavily scripted and riddled with bugs.  Dvar campaign #1, turn 1, you're told Forgive your Uncle, or Kill your Uncle, your choice.  I had to load from previous saves 12x because getting into a Non-Aggression with your Uncle caused me to start an Arena Deathmatch Quest with him.  I have multiple times assaulted an enemy base (enemy can't retreat) only to watch the bastards fly over me to retreat.  \n\nEvery problem can be fixed from patches (or expansion).  This is a good company, a so-so game, with a really cool setting.

It\u2019s just completely boring.  The research feels empty, you don\u2019t feel like \u201cI need to get this research done so I can build X\u201d.  Research is completely fruitless and nothing really happens.  The first 30-40 turns when you fist set up your colony is fun but after that it because a memory test of which zones you are dedicating to research or manufacturing etc \u2013 there isn\u2019t really any visual to give you the cues from the map screen.  This means that as your colony grows you have to keep clicking into the different colony buildings to refresh yourself.  There also isn\u2019t an indicator of population vs number of annex areas available.  It all gets a bit \u201cclickey for no reason\u201d.\n\nOn the fun side, the tactical combat is good.  What isn\u2019t good is that you get no real benefit from leading the tactical combat yourself, as often the AI vs AI will do a better job on your behalf.  Often when I play the match myself, my units can die (not so much with time and experience) but they definitely lose health.  When the AI plays the match for you, your units will mostly come out unscathed, as long as they outnumber the enemy \u2013 I don\u2019t know how they do it \u2013 so I don\u2019t.  I just let the AI do it for me and go back to the endless clicking of micromanaging my empire.\n\nI also have this huge feeling that the developers have held back a TON of stuff that they plan to release; as DLC as the game feels a bit dated.

The game isn't bad, it's not as good as AoW 3.  The units and operations are bland to me and there definitely seems to be sub optimal choices for what special tech a species should have based on their damage tracks.

It almost warrants a recommendation, but after giving it three tries it's just too bland.  \n\nThe good first.  Combat is serviceable.  It's X-Com lite.  Bits and pieces are decent.  I like how your infantry can use armor as cover.  While the alien races are all almost completely uh \"influenced\" (or ripped off completely) by movies (Borg, random machine AI aliens from that Tom Cruise flick, the bugs from Starship Troopers, Immortan Joe and the Boyz, etc) I guess they are fun.  \n\nSomebody else mentioned the unit modification stuff was really good and that's a decent point.  You can kit your guys out to be tanks or healers or whatever.  And the hero modification is fairly decent.  \n\nNow the bad.  The writing is juvenile and the characters completely forgettable.  Not kidding when I say a major plot point for the second scenario in the campaign is to make contact with a  dead empress who wants to nuke the whole planet or to resurrect a dead emperor that some Replicants (excuse me the Syndicate) want you to resurrect.  Two different lost imperial leaders.  Same mission.  While you are slogging through the missions the game throws so many quests (both story and random kill x creatures) your way you wouldn't be wrong for thinking your were playing World of Warcraft.  \n\nDiplomacy mainly involves performing said kill quests for one of the many silly factions or spending influence points to pepper someone with compliments.  Nobody really offers to run quests for you.  \n\nBy the time I had gotten in to my third game I had rushed through the entire tech tree without any thought at all.  There isn't enough there to worry about what you choose.  As near as I can tell there were only three significant technologies that unlocked airships, tanks, and mechs.  Much like an RTS, tech exists only to give you access to better units.  Sure you can get some stat bonuses in research and production and whatever.  It hardly matters for the course of the game.  A lot of it feels like filler just to give you the illusion that your choices matter in the game.  \n\nThe real sin for Planetfall is just how bogged down and bland it gets while you try to finish a scenario.  The combat can be fun the first five or so times you fight.  By my third game I was letting the AI auto resolve battles.  If you are a fan of turn based combat like this I highly recommend X-Com.  If you like 4x games (which this isn't really) there are better options.  \n\nThis isn't a broken game.

If you have never played an Age of Wonders game or 4X in general, this is still a solid turn based strategy to dive into.\n\nPros\n- High quality graphics with a broad color palette\n- Solid music and sound effects\n- Sector system makes the world feel valuable and gives deeper, more meaningful choices to expansion and warfare (Annex, Colonize, or make a Forward Base are all meaningful decisions for each sector)\n- Unit modding and gear options are a lot deeper than 3 and makes even low tier units viable in the mid to late game\n- World Gen... the maps for this game are pretty, and flow together nicely to feel like an alien world\n- Passive scanner (this makes things like finding barbarian camps in the fog a lot easier, and means you aren't likely to have a marauding stack run in from the fog of war and cap an unguarded town in a single turn).\n- New and Improved minor Factions that eventually become mututally exclusive\n- Improved Diplomacy (from previous titles), Cassus Belli and claiming mechanics\n\nNeutral\n- Lack of a few freedoms from previous titles (i.e. building roads... they are now automatically made in owned sectors)\n- Unit classification isn't as straight forward as in AoW 3 (fewer broad non-function based titles in Planetfall, instead of more specialized but easily understandable titles from AoW 3... i.e. Planetfall has a Core type, where as AoW 3 would have Archer, Infantry, or Pikeman as types... which type tells more about that unit from a glance?)\n- Multiple science trees is fresh for the series, but players will likely quickly decide on optimal build paths, making decisions here less interesting.  This could be improved on by semi-randomization or other methods to mix up the fixed research trees (other 4X games have used the \"pick one of many options\" method where some or all tiers of research have mutually exclusive choices that makes it so players have to make important choices between tech options that impact an entire game).  This could even be an option at game creation (fixed trees vs. semi-random or pool system like 3).\n\nCons\n- UI feels a bit cluttered in some places and some art choices make things not obvious to find or are hidden in menus\n- No more dual/tri layer maps (AoW 3 had the underground layer, and AoW Shadow Magic had both the underground and the shadow realm in addition to the overworld map)... maybe one of the future DLCs can bring back this feature... this game being sci-fi, adding a space layer with ships and maybe even other planets or asteroids could bring a unique flavor to this\n- No dungeons (mid to end game points of interest on the map housing some of the more challenging and rewarding fights in the game)\n\nOne of the nuances of the Age of Wonders series as a whole is that they tend to lean more towards the combat side of strategy and less towards things like diplomacy and espionage than other 4X games, making previous entries feel much more 4X-lite.  This title, while still having that combat leaning feels like more of the other \"X\"s to the 4X are fleshed out and more interesting than previous titles.  That said, I wouldn't mind a bit more depth to diplomacy and more non-combat interactions between players (human and AI), it's a new direction for the game to grow in (and it has made some good steps that way with this title).", "timestamp_created": 1565286220, "timestamp_updated": 1565286238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 82, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819989919662475586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54520620": {"recommendationid": "54520620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097511761", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 756, "last_played": 1617703039}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a veteran strategy games player and after the disappointment with AoW 3, which contrary to what many reviews claim it was in my opinion a sub-par release compared to AoW I and II, I was very reluctant to buy Planetfall, without even a demo, but I decided to give it a go since I've got plenty of time during summer holidays and it has really surprised me.\nIt is a well polished and functional release; the story and setting are completely different from its predecessors and while several new features were added (all well thought and adding further depth, IMO), the game maintained its identity: if you played and enjoyed the previous titles you will reckon its still Age of Wonders and I'm sure you will enjoy it like or more than the past ones.\n\nKudos to Triumph Studios", "timestamp_created": 1565285087, "timestamp_updated": 1565285087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54520277": {"recommendationid": "54520277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015414330", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1566500229}, "language": "english", "review": "If you've played any previous AoW games, you'll be right at home, it's a classic example of \"if it works, don't change it\".\n\nThat being said still plays just as great, modding units is fun, operations (global spells) feel good and organic for this setting, and flavour texts are an excellent example of great worldbuilding.

I rarely pre-order, and I have no regrets this time.\n\nCons: YOU CAN'T RENAME HEROES (deliberate caps).  This is one of my pet peeves for games like this, and while you can customize your main hero -- you can't rename the others.  In a 4x game, that lets you rename cities, super super annoying.  Makes it harder to keep track, immersion, etc etc. (Update: You can currently rename your heroes, something you never could do before...patch?)\n\nOther cons - None so far, it's that good of a game. \n\nPros:  There is a dearth of good games like this.  I grew up on Master of Magic, Civ, Xcom series (my alltime TBS favorite).  I often buy possibly good games (normally on sale) hoping they might be okay, and rarely they measure up.  The last ones I've liked are Warhammer 40k Gladius, Fallen Enchantress, and Galciv 2.  The Homm series hasn't had a hit in awhile.   The AOW series was good, I remember the AI being ok but the game having a nice amount of depth.  This is the same basic game, but with much better graphics (top notch for this kind of game) and in a sci-fi setting.  But very familiar.  I'm enjoying the lore injection into the game, and I reckon I'll be playing this alot with the map generator. \n\nI'm finding the factions pretty interesting and well differentiated.  So far the AI seems competent, I'm still evaluating.  It's a good game for after work when I don't want something as hectic as Mortal Kombat.  Best purchase I've made in awhile.\n\nAfter playing a little: AI seems competent both tactically and to a slightly lesser extent strategically.

It's a mid complexity grand strategy, not going as far out as say Crusader King or Hearts of Iron, but upping the complexity since Age of Wonders 3. The shift in setting from fantasy to scifi is an interesting one as well. As someone who prefers fantasy over scifi, but is open to either this game really has hit the sweet spot with me as it has something of a scifi fantasy going for it. The game itselves improves on a few of the failings of Age of Wonders 3 and has some unique and cool ideas in the way of sectors, but it also more heavily pushes faction uniqueness which is something I am very much a fan of.\n\nFaction diversity is at an all time high in this installment of the Age of Wonders franchise from the insect like Kir'ko and their swarm mechanic, to the drone oriented human Vanguards to the crime houses of the Syndicate who dwell in slavery and subjugation, and so on. All the factions are diverse and have their own unique strengths. I hope to see Triumph keep pushing these diversity quality with future releases.\n\nGameplay itself is solid. The strategic map has it's strengths with wildlife, hazards, locations of interest and pick ups (some with some minor CYOA experiences). The choices of building and build order can be a mix of linear and strategical choice (some buildings you have to get, some are more of a strategic choice) and exploring is a big factor to the game. Diplomacy can be tricky to pull off, but when done right it can be very rewarding. Sometimes choices done by AI in diplomacy can be a bit counterproductive (they are struggling against an opponent and you offer to help them out and they still won't accept), but those moments are very rare and far apart. All in all I would say the strategic map gameplay is done well.\n\nCombat aspect of the game is fantastic. It truelly feels tactical (and lethal if you don't play smart). You have to make maximum use of positioning, unit roles, unit abilities, tactical operations and terrain. A single mistake can cost you a unit. There is insane diversity in the units one can have access to, and each unit feel unique in their combat role, but on top of that you have the modification system which lets you mod your units to become more tanky, more damage dealer, give them support abilities or entirely new (and near magical) abilities like calling in a psionic storm. This really gives each unit a lot of depth and I would compare the combat to xcom in a bigger scale. The fact that each unit also rank up and get's better (and in some cases more unique traits and top rank) makes you invested in the units you have. The combat is to me the biggest strength of the game.\n\nThis is a terrific 4X game and I would highly recommend it. It can be a bit difficult in the beginning and there is a lot to take inn, but once you have it is an incredible deep game experience that you shouldn't miss out on.\n\nDisclaimer: I was given a free copy of the game, but I elected to buy the game regardless and gave away the free copy I was given.

The sector system lessens city-spamming.\nTech tree finally makes more sense instead of all random.\nDiplomacy is \"slightly\" better, more options and NPC dwellings are more interesting and involved.\nCombats is deepers, with new covering and overwatch mechanics.\nOverall graphic and animation improvement.\nMod-system is clever to make T1 unit more useful late-game, kind-of lessen T4 spamming, a little.\n\nThe bad\n\nNot a fan of Sci-Fi setting. A personal taste...\nLess heros costumization, you either choose average-looking or the downright ugly. 2-3 looks.\nInterface is over-complicated and some game-concepts are unclear and poorly explained. Will get getter as I play more for sure.\nI miss the old race-class combo add a lot to the costumization. You now have secret-tech which is kind of class-ish but not as big a game-changer as the previous game.\n\nOverall very enjoyable experience. There is enough improvement than just a re-skinned AOW3.

There's multi-shot ranged, single-shot ranged, melee, and healer, and 80% of the units just feel like that. Even higher tier units with multiple abilities often feel like just another gun, and not even a more interesting gun. The upgrade system is really neat, but it can't carry the combat. It's also very annoying that 70% of the game is spent with 32-moves units, and then you hit tier 3-4 and suddenly everything has 24 moves.\n\nHeroes are missing a little something as well. The removal of some of the AOW3 level-up and equipment options is - I will say - good (I'm particularly thinking of %resistances, as it frequently resulted in several damage immunities), but as of now they feel a little bare. Maybe they just need level-up options that better encourage specialized combat roles. The current specialization stuff - piloting, melee skill, etc - is small, simple, and competes with the other options, all of which are more interesting, and yet at the same time don't make them feel particularly different. The most interesting things on heroes are their items, and as much as I may like the jetpacks, that's not how it should be (though an extra hero equipment slot specifically for active hero items may still be an improvement).\n\nThe biggest problem for me, though, is that I just don't like any of the factions. They're different, sure, but I don't like them. Vanguard is actually my favorite faction, and I usually avoid the generics. None of the factions are particularly exciting, and the Vanguard is the most honest about it so I go with them I guess.\n\nI like sneaky stuff, but in this game that's the Syndicate (which is more about corporate debt-slavery), Synthesis (magic spacepunk communism) and Psynumbra (maniacally evil psionic doomsday cult), none of which have any class. I like hypermobile teleportation stuff, which Voidtech kinda suggests it has and then fails to deliver. I like honest, coolheaded heroes, but Vanguard is so very bland. I like mind-magic, but for that my choices are bugs (Kir'Ko), capital double-EE EEVIL (Psynumbra), glowy-handed faux-enlightenment (Celestian) or the Syndicate.\n\nNow... all that said - even though all the attempts at personality in this game fell flat - it's got a good gameplay loop and I enjoy it, so it gets a thumbs-up from me.

Because it has elements of all X4 titles mentioned above!\n\nI will keep updating this list as the release is still young and there is much to be tested! :)\n\n[u]Pros:[/u]\n[list]\n    [*]Very unique races/heroes/units that are highly customizable but still unique (think dwarves, borg, zerg, amazons, space marines, dinosaurs, mechs, elder, lasers, guns, psy, brawler, sniper, vehicles, ...)\n    [*]Quests and developing your heroes are as important as expanding and colony/sector management\n    [*]really fun and engaging colony/sector system (no boring hex grabbing as in civ)\n    [*]minor NPC factions really matter. oftentimes it is more beneficail to do quests for them than to stomp them\n    [*]manual battles load fast and are really fun to play. unit starting positions are mirrored from the tactical map.\n    [*]graphics and sounds/music are totally enjoyable\n    [*]Multiplayer seems to work great at release! (looking at you TotalWar!)\n[/list]\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\n[list]\n    [*]The AI on the tactical level needs to improve. It is not bad per se but sometimes feels bland\n    [*]diplomacy with the main factions sometimes feels inconsequential. AI switches from love to war in no time.\n    [*]Some minor bugs that sometimes fix themselves like stuck units. (autosaves after each turn!)\n    [*]some UI improvements could be made here and there, but nothing that bothers too much\n[/list]\n\nTake Civilization, endless legend, Heroes of Might and Magic and sprinkle it with a bit of Warhammer, Starcraft and Jurassic Park and you get Planetfall.\n\n9/10 Would buy again", "timestamp_created": 1565243068, "timestamp_updated": 1565243249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504991650581359863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54512020": {"recommendationid": "54512020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083491559", "num_games_owned": 567, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 468, "last_played": 1595277676}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game so far ill even get the season pass if they add more races to play as, it would be better if u could play the npc factions", "timestamp_created": 1565242593, "timestamp_updated": 1565242593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504991650581359863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54511292": {"recommendationid": "54511292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129598695", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1057, "last_played": 1612493084}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1565237972, "timestamp_updated": 1565237972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444540530443191528", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54511249": {"recommendationid": "54511249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028209057", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 5619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 662, "last_played": 1605587813}, "language": "english", "review": "Played 11hrs and its only a day after release since this review.

It also has some RPG mechanisms as you can upgrade your hero/leader and change it visuals. \n\nVisuals:\nGraphics are nice, animations on the main map are fluid, there is lots of stuff going on around on the map, it looks very alive - even during combat phase, when you have your team on the field. Did not notice any issues with the game in general.\n\nGameplay: \nExpansion is based on researching 2 types of technologies - Military and Society. They are being extended in sub categories (some kind of boosts) that you can enable during the campaign, and every researched technology gives u mods/weapon or some buildings to be build. You can choose several specializations for your main character (like biological warfare or some other - based on other technologies). Every colony (city) can be created and extended by surrounding sub-sectors. Nice idea in general as You can not create city next to the city so you will have some kind of a chain of colonies connected by sub-sectors and roads (roads are created automatically). Sectors are similar to Civilization tiles, but way bigger, and they also extend borders of your colony city that they are part of, you can choose to assimilate sector or create base in it if you dont have enough colonists.\n\nAnother nice feature is creating templates for your units, templates can be applied automatically to all of them so it lowers the amount of micromanagement. Every unit can be modded/upgraded with researched technology. There is a lot of replayability - I already started campaign 5x and every time it looked a little bit different. It plays like any typical 4x, with some fresh looks here and then so its not boring. I assume it will be upgraded with the DLCs (its Paradox after all) and free content - but this time Paradox learned its mistakes and did not release empty shell (like in case of Imperator:Rome) - so even now game has enough content to keep you busy. Its fresh, its nice, its interesting - so if you like 4X genre this is something you should have in your collection. \n\nTotally recommended!!!\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1565213566, "timestamp_updated": 1565213566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479337632656097412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54507560": {"recommendationid": "54507560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007301516", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 432, "last_played": 1587923178}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoying the game a lot so far.

In my opinion, a review should come from a perspective of thorough understanding\u2014sometimes it is difficult to fully comprehend flaws or brilliance in design until you have played a game for a while.  After all, what could I possibly have to say about a game that I played for less than an hour? \n\nQuite a lot, apparently. \n\nAs a disclaimer, I won't pretend that this is a complete review.  It picks at a few very specific aspects of the game that really destroyed any chance I had of enjoying the experience.  I really wrestled with whether to even write this.  I gave myself time to cool down.  I went to bed, woke up, and headed to work.  Now, sitting at my computer in my office, I haven't cooled off one bit.  I'm still annoyed, and I need to get this out.  If you are completely new to the [i]Age of Wonders[/i] franchise, or you don't care at all about multiplayer gameplay, maybe consider passing on this review.  I don't think it will serve you particularly well. \n\nStill here?  Well, then.  First, a bit of tedious history.  I may be dating myself, but I still have clear memories of the day, nearly twenty years ago, when I first played [i]Age of Wonders[/i].  At the time, I was practically addicted to [i]Heroes of Might and Magic III[/i], but I hadn't yet found my way to Sid Meier's [i]Civilization[/i] franchise.  Therefore, a lot of [i]Age of Wonder's[/i] mechanics were entirely new to me.  \n\nI thought it was great.  I played it for hours at a time.  I would listen to the music and read the lore on the unit description pages.  Eventually, I played the game so much that it became rote\u2014I knew the AI's tendencies, its weaknesses and patterns, and how to exploit them.  Winning was just a matter of solving a puzzle.  I became bored.  With fond memories, I put the game away, with no real desire to ever play it again.  I was 11 years old at the time. \n\nAs time passed and I grew older, I would often think back on my experience with [i]Age of Wonders[/i] and (pardon the pun) wonder what had happened.  Why was it that I grew bored with the game in a way that I never did with [i]Heroes III[/i]?  As my tastes and understanding of gaming evolved, I realized the answer:  I played [i]Heroes III[/i] with friends.  My friends challenged me in ways that the AI never did.  I had to understand the game\u2014truly understand it, not just know how to outsmart the feeble AI\u2014in order to stand a chance of beating them.  The more we played, the better and better we got.  There were tactics and counter-tactics.  Feints.  Rushes.  \n\nI never did convince any of my friends to play [i]Age of Wonders[/i].  No fault on the game; it was just circumstance. \n\nFast forward to 2014.  Fifteen years of experiences had left me jaded.  The stories and lore no longer titillated in the way they once had.  The music was all on YouTube.  But even so, having skipped over all of the various permutations of [i]Age of Wonders II[/i], I was pleased to hear about the release of [i]Age of Wonders III[/i].  This time, I railroaded my friends into buying the game with me.  I was ready to enjoy a new, fresh multiplayer experience. \n\nWe quickly ran into an obstacle.  \"Simultaneous turns,\" a convenience which decades of fast-paced multiplayer games had left us ill-suited to do without, apparently did not include combat.  In fact, not only could two players not conduct combat simultaneously, but [i]everyone[/i] had to wait on the person who was in battle.  You couldn't do [i]anything[/i], not even take a look at your unit tiers or hero abilities.  Oh, you could also watch the other person's combat . . . thus potentially revealing the disposition of their units and their hero abilities.  That made a lot of sense.  \n\nYou can imagine how this could get out of hand with more than two players.  Sure, you could just auto every combat, but what's the point of that?  We were definitely disappointed.  No small amount of mockery was directed my way for having been the person who instigated the entire debacle.  Humiliated, I consoled myself by trying to play single player, only to find that it was . . . boring.  I wasn't that wide-eyed 11-year-old anymore, to be impressed by lore or the soundtrack.  I wanted [i]gameplay[/i] . . . and that was lacking.  Within a couple of games, I was destroying the AI on the hardest difficulty.  Overall, while it was a competent game, it felt like a weaker title than the original [i]Age of Wonders[/i], which shocked me.  After 15 years and multiple sequels, surely they could do better?  With a heavy heart, I shelved the game. \n\nAlmost five more years later, enter [i]Age of Wonders:  Planetfall[/i].  I didn't bat an eye at the title.  Now beyond jaded, I couldn't care less as to whether the game took place in fantasyland or in space.  It could take place in South Africa for all I care.  [i]Just show me a good game.[/i]  Once again, I rallied the troops, convincing a friend to play with me on release day.  I didn't question that our multiplayer issue from last time would be fixed.  Plenty of people had complained about it before, and this was five years later.  There was no \"early access\" nonsense, this was a full release.  Of [i]course[/i] it would be fixed.  I didn't even bother asking.\n\nWe didn't bother with the tutorial.  We just jumped right into a multiplayer game.  Despite some people complaining of launch issues, we seemed good to go.  I was able to easily jump into my friend's game and we made our blind selections of faction, hero, and secret technology.  Everything was going smoothly.  I played my first turn, saw a nearby resource node guarded by some enemies, and sent my hero and his army to claim it.  Oblivious that anything untoward might be happening, I set about my self-appointed task:  the massacre of the independents that were standing on my resources.  That was when it happened. \n\n\"Are you in combat?\"  I hear the question, and my heart sinks.  I know what it means.  But I don't want to believe it. \n\n\"Yes,\" I answer cautiously.  \"Why?\" \n\n\"I can't do anything.\"\n\nNo!  Not again!  I'm simply blown away.  How?  How could they have done it?  Surely there is some mistake.  We quit out of the game and go to check the settings to make sure that we didn't miss the option to turn on simultaneous combat.  No such option exists.  I check the discussion board, and sure enough, the question has been asked and answered by a developer representative, who essentially says, \"it was too difficult to bother with.\" \n\nMy friend took one for the team and continued playing until it was too late for him to refund the game (though he surely tried after about four hours), so I do have some idea of how the game plays.  There's hardly anything new to see here.  It feels like someone slapped a futuristic skin over [i]Age of Wonders III[/i].  My friend was playing on the hardest difficulty, and before I had to stop watching and go to bed, I got the feeling that he was winning pretty handily.  Sure, there are a few tweaks and features here and there, but it doesn't matter at all.  The AI is . . . well, a computer, and the multiplayer doesn't work.  Where's the fun?  \n\nI'm aware that some people will disagree with me on this.  That's okay.  To each their own, and if you enjoy battling the AI in single player, more power to you.  I just don't think there's any longevity in this title.  There's no challenge, no innovation, no soul.  Simultaneous combat was \"too difficult\" to implement?  After five years, and a $50 price tag on what purports to be a full release version of this game?\n\nUnacceptable.", "timestamp_created": 1565209437, "timestamp_updated": 1565209437, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499217867851257324", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54506816": {"recommendationid": "54506816", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973218037", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 6003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 460, "last_played": 1610219558}, "language": "english", "review": "Good combat oriented x4 game in a sci-fi universe,", "timestamp_created": 1565209405, "timestamp_updated": 1565209405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459610015153884888", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54506535": {"recommendationid": "54506535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047902374", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1565873515}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll keep this short and simple, since it's a Paradox game and it won't even matter at all. Even though the game looks gorgeous and seems to have a good level of complexity, I can't get over the fact that:\n\n1. You cannot currently play a random map. All previous AOW games had this from the start. Why strip it out?!\n\nEDIT: Actually you can play random maps, but the developers didn't give a rat's ass to make it clear enough in the clogged up UI. In the Scenario menu you can go to the Advanced tab and customize your world and such. And there is NO INFORMATION ANYWHERE telling you that about it. If you don't do that, you'll be facing some retarded limitations, like being unable to play an Enormous map with less than 8 players. Why? God knows what's in the minds of the people that made these design decisions (probably not much tbh). And again, you are not being told that these settings can actually be customized in the Advanced section, while the first impression is that the game is forcing you to play a certain way. \n\n2. One of the most stupid design decisions is still here:  you cannot easily (or at all?) change which hero is the commander of the army, if you have more than one hero in that army. Again, why?! Would it be that hard to put a checkbox on each hero unit from an army and make the one selected the commander?!\n\n3. Just like in previous series, you don't seem to be able to get rid of the \"Handle new hero join offer\" spam. For the last time, is it that damn hard to add a \"Dismiss\" button there, which simply removes that hero from the map?!\n\n4. You CANNOT dismiss units. Or at least I did not find the button to do it. Sorry if I'm just being blind, but if not, then this is beyond retarded. Good luck managing your energy income this way and hope you find some powerful neutrals to suicide your army into.\n\nProvided that, for the 100th time, they release a game just to \"let it out\", or, even worse, they decided to stick to the stupid design decisions from the past games, I currently cannot recommend this game, no matter how good it might be at first sight.\n\nI believe it's time we asked for better quality in the details and game play, than in the graphics, especially FOR A 50 EURO GAME. I'm really tired of being thrown in the same boat as 15 year-old kids that only want to look at shiny things, then cry to their parents to buy them the game.\n\nPS: I'm not mentioning any bugs, even though I found a few (like being unable to click the end turn button, and only CTRL+Enter working even though I had a secondary key setup as well), because, like Paradox did in the past, this game is actually in Beta and we are testing it for them, while even paying them to do it!

Cover now significantly affects attack missing rate just like XCOM, making combat less predictable than AOW3 where HP attacks never miss and the target's defense/resistance simply reduce damage. BTW I think AOW3's combat mechanism is an improvement to AOW1/2 where units' static defense value determine missing chance in an uncontrollable/unintelligible way. Now your unit's attack can still miss just like in AOW2 but at least there are some factors you can control and manipulate. \n- Flying units no longer idiotically stand on the ground when not moving, as in AOW3. Not sure if this means they are immune to ground melee attacks (as in earlier AOW games). When I play AOW3 I just hate to see my T4 fire dragon flanked to death by a bunch of low tier infantries.    \n\nCons:\n- Inconsistent voice acting. Only played random scenarios so far. Some of the tutorial/tech tree narrations are done horribly as if they come right out of alpha stage. Combat voice acting remains disappointing. \n- UI needs polishing. On the strategical map some figures/icons appear without any explanation.

You can really tell that they've taken note of what was well recieved in AoW:III and what wasn't, having a lot of fun so far. \n\nThis will not be an indepth-review, not at the moment. Might come back and make a \"real\" one after I've played it for at least 100h :P\"\n\nI've totally changed my stance on this game after playing a few more hours. I've also read a few reviews which I agree with to the most parts, and a TL;DR version of my current state of mind regarding this game is: \n\nWait for sale.\n\nIt has a few parts of AoW:III, a few parts of AoW:II Shadow Magic and a bit of its own... but nothing really stands out. The more you play it, the more you find out that all factions are kind of rehashes of each other, all units are the same with different damage types, all tanks are the same, all walkers are the same and it feels so bland when you start playing a new game, with another faction and it plays out the exakt same way as the last one. Same composition, same research, same kinds of battles. \n\nThe NPC factions are mostly annoying, and feels very forced. \"We need to have quests and constant battles to keep it interesting\"-ish. I can see why they added an option to not have the NPC factions send armies at you while you're at war with them, because you will most likely be in war with all other NPC's except for one, since they all hate eachother and you're punished for doing a rivaling factions quests. \n\nThe way to play seems to be to just focus on mods and tier II units, or just play anything that deals mostly psi-damage, which destroys about everything you'll face in combat. \n\n\"Paradox-hurr durr\" reviews was something that I frowned upon at first, but knowing the AoW creators history and the love and interest they've shown during the making of AoW:III, it feels like they've kinda been forced to make this kinda unfinished/unpolished game which demands DLC and expansions to be a full game, very much like most late Paradox releases. \n\nIt will probably be a great game once it is finished, but right now it feels like early access. \nStill having kinda fun though, waiting for the modding community to fix most lol.", "timestamp_created": 1565194900, "timestamp_updated": 1565530063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556165933609008789", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54503580": {"recommendationid": "54503580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005087995", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 14644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1605430553}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer: Volunteer beta tester for Planetfall but *not* an employee of either Triumph or Paradox. More than 500hrs playtime with the beta build. \n\nIt'd be easy to go on a long tirade but what it comes down to with Planetfall is a huge amount of customization, combinations and permutations in its gameplay. When you start thinking about all the possible combinations of races, secret tech, mods, NPC faction units and mods, commander traits, hero weapons and equipment, operations and map factors your mind begins to race with all the possibilities.\n\nIt's an awesome game not just for people who enjoy turn based strategy but even more so for those who enjoy coming up with different \"builds\", it's almost like an rpg in that way and the visual customization in Commander Creation certainly rivals character creation in many actual rpgs. \n\nMaybe you want a multi-racial Syndicate slave army that absorbs other races (peacefully or not), puts slave collars on their units, make them cheaper with the Indentured Contracts doctrine and then buffs, or even ressurrects them, with slave empowering support units while at the same time playing nice with neutral factions and establishing relations with them that are both peaceful and profitable. \n\nOr maybe you play with Synthesis tech, get friendly with the plant based Growth faction, get a bunch of Vine Bud units, put mods on them that allow them to regenerate, resurrect after dying and summon tiny aggressive \"daemon\" robots and then proceed to summon slews of tentacled vines, that can also regenerate and resurrect because they inherit those mods from the Vine Bud, tiny robots that can take over mechanical units upon death and then you use the Network Link unit to refresh Vine Buds' abilities to summon more vines and tiny robots and THEN as your enemies start to die the Network Link strips away their consciousness to refresh its refreshing ability which it uses to refresh the Vine Buds to make MORE vines and tiny robots. \n\nMaybe you could also give your entire army extra shielding and regeneration via tactical operations but that'd be crazy, right? :) I know this sounds confusing but it's a thing, I promise.\n\nOr maybe you play a fiery Promethean Amazon whose Arborean Queens entangle whole armies allowing you to drop canisters of explosive, choking gas on them while preventing them from moving out of it. \n\nOf course you can always go for the classic tanks and artillery creeping barrage. \n\nThere is also stealth, espionage, diplomacy, dire penguins, doomsday victory conditions, colony management, exploration and eldritch horrors and they all play into this buffet of gameplay options. \n\nMy advice to new players is to read the tooltips, look at the unit info cards, take the time to understand unit abilities and how they interact. Gradually it will all click into place. \n\nUnlike in previous games Planetfall's tactical combat can now be fully played in asynchronous multiplayer, a.k.a. \"play-by-email\", no need to use auto-combat for PvP unless you want to. Sure, matches can take a very long time like this but you can play them at your leasure with no time pressure and if all players happen to be online at the same time you can seamlessly switch to direct multiplayer and then go back to asynchronous later.

So it comes as no surprise that Planetfall is in position to eclipse it. The setting in Planetfall, coupled with a lacing of Triumphs tongue-in-cheek humor (dinosaurs with lasers, finally!) makes this title standout in a big way. All things being equal, I love a good sci-fi setting (more than fantasy), and so Planetfall is destined to appeal.\n\nThankfully, Triumph Studios has crafted Planetfall\u2019s mechanics and gameplay systems with the same thoroughness, attention to detail, and eye towards challenging gameplay that has been a hallmark of the entire Age of Wonders series. The factions are varied in lore and aesthetics, and when coupled with secret technologies provides scores of different unit, mod, and ability combinations to experiment with. All of the strategic dimensions of the game funnel into a best-in-class tactical combat system that feels even richer than AoW3\u2019s already exceptional system. Bigger combat maps, more varied terrain, tons of unit abilities and synergies.\n\nThe empire management side of the game has been greatly expanded in complexity (and somewhat in depth) relative to Age of Wonders 3 (which was criticized for being too \"lite\"). The sector-based development system deepens the gameplay and puts players into direct competition for the choicest expansion sites. The race secure Cosmite (a strategic resource, can be tight!). When coupled with an aggressive AI and lots of opposing factions on dense and intricate gamemaps, it is an intoxicating mix. The minor (aka NPC) factions add a great wrinkle to the geopolitical game, forcing judicious use of the influence resource.\n\nOf course, it isn\u2019t all perfect. Lost in the translation from AoW3, is the seals victory system, which was among the more brilliant design moves of the series.  Hopefully we see a version of this return to Planetfall in the future. I also miss AoW3\u2019s blind and randomized tech tree (cough\u2026 spell book) since it prevented players from settling into predictable build paths. And I also miss the magic specializations, as they greatly expanded the possible permutations of strategies at your disposal. But these are relatively minor gripes to overall solid experience.\n\nAll in all, Triumph Studios have outdone themselves yet again and stitched together one of the finest 4X games I\u2019ve ever played. At release, the game is solid, robust, and complete feeling.

It lacks the dynamic, exceptional elements that were core in Age of Wonders 3, it feels almost like a cheap mod of 3, not a fully developed game on its own.\n\nThis is more comparable to Civilizations: Beyond Earth, than I think anyone is comfortable with. It offers a few solid steps into the future, but for the most part, the changes aren't that substantial, and the content is less than desirable. I made the mistake of purchasing the game through a third-party site, which means that I have no recourse in searching for a refund (Humble Bundle, though I have submitted an online refund request, we'll see how that goes), but after 91 minutes, I've seen the entire tech tree, and I've gotten a fair look at the content that awaits me.\n\nThe leveling / upgrade system is less extensive than it was in AoW 3 for your Leader, and the research system is honestly kinda small. It went with a Civilization-style system, but that doesn't really fit with the game, in my opinion, whereas the prior system in AoW 3 was all about choosing what kinds of interesting new things you wanted to add, this one lacks that.\n\nSpells were changed to 'Operations', some of which were okay, but for the most part they're kinda boring. They add the occasional new factor, but the combat lacks the 'wow' moments that even Beyond Earth had (Civilizations), and especially none of the epicness that defined AoW 3, it feels like a less ambitious product.\n\nAs stated above, cosmetic character customization sucks, the female characters in particular look like men, wish I was kidding, and beyond that there's not a lot of you can do to differentiate yourself (beyond some edgy stuff).\n\nOnto the meat of the game, the Strategic and Tactical content, the Strategic level is pretty much just a discount mix of Civilization or Endless Legends (more the latter than the former, as 6 has WAAAAY more in-depth than that, and I panned Civ 6, beginning to think unfairly, for a 'lack' of content, comparatively it is flushed in it). There's new zones you can expand into, non-interactive, you just plop down a demand for land once your Pop grows, pretty much. Minor factions are more or less a copy of Endless Legends, again, a downgrade.\n\nIn my 91 minutes, I did not encounter any of the interesting tidbits that AoW 3 had, such as Dungeons, the uber-dangerous Underground areas, which gave the game a LoTR feel (going through the Mines of Moria, dealing with massive dragons, running for your life to save on time).\n\nAoW 3 also had an AMAZING loot system, gearing up your various characters felt like a light Dungeon Crawler, this one doesn't really have that either. \n\nTactical Combat, rounds are over in the blink of an eye, the weapons feel like they lack a presence, the tactical elements of the prior entry feel...missing, they're kinda there, but not really. There's not as much crazy stuff that you can do either, just in general, the game feels like Beyond Earth did to Civ 5, as this does to AoW 3, there ARE improvements, but they're otherwise drowned out by the mediocrity of the rest of the game.\n\n-\n\nEdit:\n\nHumble did end up refunding me", "timestamp_created": 1565153458, "timestamp_updated": 1565154223, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 272, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.6872672438621521", "comment_count": 30, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54495639": {"recommendationid": "54495639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009178718", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 143, "last_played": 1565144074}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoy XCOM and Civilization, you will probably love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1565153443, "timestamp_updated": 1565153443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617423117160797119", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54495580": {"recommendationid": "54495580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003229310", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 384, "last_played": 1565578798}, "language": "english", "review": "day1-review : I am loving it, time flew today playing it", "timestamp_created": 1565152945, "timestamp_updated": 1565152945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511155188083648682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54495554": {"recommendationid": "54495554", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970348980", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 388, "last_played": 1602953961}, "language": "english", "review": "Its Age of Wonders 3, but with some improvements here and there and a Sci-fi theme.\n\nIf you liked AoW3, then you are gonna like this.", "timestamp_created": 1565152789, "timestamp_updated": 1565152789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54495471": {"recommendationid": "54495471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021862116", "num_games_owned": 601, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 3877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 711, "last_played": 1605837082}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very enjoyable game.

Triumph developers promised all veteran AoW players, that being owned by Paradox didn't mean that they would decide how their games should be, or they would not seal this deal. \n\nI had mixed feelings about the game, but so far I am very impressed.\nI played AoW1, AoW2 and Shadow Magic, AoW3 with all expansions to oblivion and back. It is probably THE most favorite game series for me. \nThere are a lot of additions in the game that I quite like - for example customising your units and creating new templates. A lot of managment, I would say that there is more of that than in previous AoW games. Not sure if that is a welcome addition for me but well, I have yet to see. \nI was afraid I would not like the races, but in reality, what I saw so far I found quite good. \nExcited to play more!\nAnd! One big thing: there are MOD TOOLS from the launch! For AoW3 we had to wait for a loooong time for them to be released.\nSo, a combination of mod tools, incoming DLCs (and Triumph mostly does very good quality DLCs) make me very hopeful for the promising future.\n\nThe ONLY thing I would wish for are better animations and effects, it is problem for Triumph since they switched to 3d (yes, for a very long time indeed). Maybe they just don't want to fire their greybearded animators? It seemed a bit weird to me that, while the overall graphics improved tenfold, the animations actually stayed THE SAME like in AoW3 (and a lot of people complained about them at that time as well). Well, Triumph always cared for gameplay a lot more than for graphics, which I can't say is a bad thing. For example, I played all the AoWs since the very first one (which year was that, 1997?) to death, while I really could not get into some of the newer 4X games with better graphics like Endless Legend or Warlock.

Guess it's time to tell all the mountain dwellers past, present and future they can't live in the mountains no more.\n\nOne city can only handle 5 sectors, including the one it is on.\n\nThere is a bug where your screen will scroll in tactical combat, which requires you to press WASD keys to counteract the endless scrolling just so you can select your units and give orders with your mouse, and of course, see what you are doing.\n\nCustom maps don't have a save setting, so every time you start a new map, you have to start from scratch, the planet's name is randomized. You cannot preview the maps. It would also be nice to set your preference of sector type to land and which sector borders it. You're in a ship and you land, why can't you select the terrain in which you land?\n\nAfter changing the city name, some notifications refer to the default name of a colony, which can be quite confusing if you have multiple cities.\n\nSelecting pickups to none in the scenario editor, still enables pickups.\nSelecting settlements to none in the scenario editor, still enables settlements.\n\nOn scenario maps, the mountains that are uninhabitable are still present on the map even when you turn the mountain terrain to 0. Actually all terrain does this. They are still present.\n\nIt is impossible to create a planet that has only one or two features, so creating Endor is impossible.\n\nCombat utilizes cover and each \"unit\" within a squad can fire (3 shots per Vanguard Unit, up to 18 shots per army stack of six of this unit).\n\nSome of the tutorial repeats itself, and there's one step of claiming territory it doesn't cover properly. If it does, I must have missed it with the rest of the ramblings of the game, with a full dialog of text, but only half of it is actually voiced.\n\nIt appears only two voice actors worked on this, oh wait, there's more later on in the research trees.

the gender (if it's not an Amazon) will result in the name changing (if you go back to edit it) causing you to save a new type of commander on top of the old one (new name and all).\n\nDiplomacy isn't completely one sided unless it's a random NPC on the map, then it gets ridiculous.\n\nOverall I'd recommend waiting for a sale, or they add more factions/leader options.", "timestamp_created":

To be expected at launch, and probably a little ahead of the curve for Paradox Interactive's standards of games at launch (*cough*imperator*cough*).\n[*]I really like the colony expansion mechanic so far.

It may come in a future update but it\u2019s just idiotic why it\u2019s not even an option.  \nEdit: They've added this in the latest patch.\n\nCompared to most other 4X\u2019s, AoW system is \u2018lightweight\u2019 empire-building (still). This time around though, you can\u2019t/don\u2019t-want-to build everything, everywhere, at all times like in AoW 3. This is great news as that game had utterly braindead city development system. The sector mechanic is the system responsible for this. You actually have to make difficult decisions now and they\u2019ll have consequences. Influence is a resource worth mentioning as it can severely impact the game in a very non-linear and unpredictable fashion - this is always welcome in the often-stale-late-game 4X\u2019s.\n\nUnits are VERY expensive to build thus unit preservation is always your #1 priority in battles. This means spamming armies is not really a thing (of the races I\u2019ve played so far at least), which IMO is a good thing. But it could potentially mean games drag on for long periods of time without anyone decidedly dominating. Not sure if this is true, need to play some more and see the late game.\n\nRaces are all unique (regarding units & research not so much eco & diplomacy) if somewhat having that bland, generic sci-fi feel to them. Story is somewhat good but nothing out of the ordinary in the world of sci-fi/high fantasy. \n\nBattles have the same pacing issue as AoW 3, takes forever to resolve when more than 3 armies are involved (especially since cover is abundant this time around and AI always use it) but maybe some of you like it this way as it does have that \u201cepic\u201d feel to it. Seems that every single unit have some special ability or passive effect of some sort. And thus, all units are useful in some way and most are lethal when used correctly. This makes the game more tactical and difficult but also much more complex and unpredictable. \n\nSpeaking of which, it seems like higher tier units aren\u2019t at all your go-to units, as they\u2019re incredibly expensive and have different strengths & weakness compared to lower tier units (in other words, high tier units are rarely straight \u201cupgrades\u201d of a previous tier unit) and may have different roles altogether. This is a welcome change compared to AoW 3 where T6 spam was the only viable late army \u2018strategy\u2019. Army customization is decent. Not much depth to it but then again we didn\u2019t have this option in AoW 3. \n\nAI is competent in battles. Their units take cover and focus fire and use abilities appropriately whenever possible. This is a major requirement for me to recommend this game and they passed it.\n\nOverall, significant improvements in the unit dynamics and army composition front massively adds to the enjoyment of the already excellent tactical battles from AoW 3 and improving the city-building aspect in a meaningful way is enough for me to recommend this game even with my low in-game hours.", "timestamp_created": 1565133965, "timestamp_updated": 1565464716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 70, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.789701581001281738", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54492561": {"recommendationid": "54492561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142636604", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1617941396}, "language": "english", "review": "The love child of AoW and Alpha Centauri.\n\n2 hours in, enjoying the campaign so far.

Less complex in management than Civ when you just want to kill things with your army and have fun. \nIf you liked AOW3 then this is much better. As good as AOW Shadow Magic. (Please get good mod support).  If your a fan of them then buy now to support them (I did) otherwise if you are not sure wait a bit for a sale. It is a good game and can be confusing when you start if you don't know AOW so look up some How To video's. There is a lot of detail that is beneath the surface. \n\nBreak it down: \nGraphics are good, but at times can be a wee bit visually clutterred . KInda like a few too many beauty marks when one is enough.\n\nOverall Management is much better than AOW Fantasy like no more just wam bam, but they know some damn tricks too. Just dont ask where they learned it from. ;>\n\nDiplomacy: Yeah its kinda there like the white chicken meat in a fast food nugget. But you dont go to AOW to do wimpy things like talking about your feelings do you? A good gun solves it all. \n\nTech: seems abilities seems good. Laid out so you can see what you need to develop next which is much better than before. I really like how you can upgrade units. Very nice. \n\nSound/Music Quality is not bad, just wish there was better music reflecting the situation. KInda like the only song is Marvin's S. Healing and it may be my step sister coming over. Better than my mom coming over, but still need some diversity. \n\nCombat is very similar to AOW Fantasy and much better than CIV. If this game took it's combat with Civ manegment it would be freaken heaven. And a very long game yes, but worth being married. \nHero customization is excellent and seems almost SIM like. \n\nSingle MAP generation is well done, but only 4 world types makes me a bit sad. Like take out food from a certain nationality and you are still hungry after your done. I hope you can add more with mods and not just DLC. Please dont paradox the DLC... please... the DLC for AOW was really nice and sweet portion size. \n\nThe campaign. Edit overall it was a lot of fun. At times some maps drove me crazy (with little islands), but the mission types varried and were great intro into factions. \n\nI have only done 2 missions, but it is odd how it is laid out right now with only 1st missions from 3 races. Ah well if they truly have Mod support like AOW Shadow Magic (and not AOW 3) this game will be a freaken classic. \nWithout that it is still a good game and worth a buy.Overall 8.5 to 8.7 out of 10 with the AOW3 being an 8 and AOW Shadow Magic being a 9.", "timestamp_created": 1565129197, "timestamp_updated": 1574895981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54491768": {"recommendationid": "54491768", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989254794", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 376, "playtime_forever": 1280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1280, "last_played": 1566283824}, "language": "english", "review": "[list][h1]good[/h1]\n[*]Unit/Hero equipment\n[*]Territory/Expansion System\n[/list]\n[list][h1]meh[/h1]\n[*]Leader Customization\n[*]Tech Tree\n[/list]\n[list][h1]doodoo[/h1]\n[*]UI\n[*]Lazy Diplomacy\n[*]Consistently Bad Voice Acting/Dialog\n[*]Incohesive Visual Design\n[/list]\nThe mechanics are good but the aesthetic is a bit iffy, as overall design looks inconsistent and generally generic. There's also plenty of lazy stuff that makes Planetfall feel more like a tutorial than something meant to engross a player into its world. For some reason they found it necessary to note NPC factions are NPCs instead of minor factions or something? Little things like that stand-out in a very pointlessly lazy way. Diplomacy is stiff and empty of flavor, extremely lacking compared to both the Endless and Civilization series. \n\nLeader customization only makes-up for it a little bit but hardly. There isn't much selection in terms of customization and plenty of the options look awful. Speaking of lazy, female models look like male ones with the boob slider dragged up to 200%. It's painfully obvious that they made a lot of shortcuts and that this game could have used a year more of development.\n\nExpansion is more interesting given that you can either grow your cities or make a new one, or just plop an outpost down. Units can be given upgrades based on your technology. As a whole, I really do like the meaty mechanic stuff but wish the UI was more stylized and easier to navigate. All the buttons in combat usually only have two colors: grey and black/yellow.

Really like the addition of cover. \n\nAlso reminds me of civ 5 with cities, diplomacy and even a research tree. Each is similar to civ 5 but works in slightly different ways and interacts in a unique way with the heroes and visit sites and quests. This gives the game an entirely unique feel and with the improved combat system the game is far better.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\n\nOk - they are not as good as Age of Wonders III - not really what I expect of a game at \u00a340 but good enough once you get used to the style.\n\nUI: 9/10\n\nExcellent.

I played the first campaign map and the tutorial. The game started without problems after i created a paradox account. The performance is fine on ultra settings. I run it on a ancient 1080 ti grafic card on 1900 1600 resolution. No problems. The grafics look cool. The human vanguard faction units i saw look cool, the enemy units too. Cant wait to see more units and factions.\n\nThe Campaign is a series of skirmish matches on predefined planets with missions on the surface and a big objective. There is a background story about a fallen star empire, you are survivors of this empire and you have to find out what happened. So post galactic apocalypse setting. Sounds cool.\n\nThere are different factions you can play. Like humans, space dwarfs, cyborgs, plant biomorph things and space amazons. They have different units and tech trees. On top of the factions there is another tech tree choice. Between Void tech and pyrotech biotech and religious tech. So you can customize and finetune your faction and take different directions into what you want to develope and what warfare style you want to use. More peacefull, more aggressive.\n\nThere is no limit to the expansion. Go wide or go bust. I like that playstyle.\n\nI can not say much about diplomacy or ai on the battlefield. It behaves quite good on the tactical battle side. It focus fires and tries to use cover. The AI lets you come to them, it does not rush you. It reacts to your movement and actions. The AI is not passive. It likes to camp near explosive traps on the battle map, though. You can exploid that.\n\nCompared to other 4x games it is more battle oriented then Civilization 6 i think. The battles are turnbased and you fight armies against armies on a special battlemap. Not 1 vs 1 like in Civ 6 on the main map. The battles can become very big with several armies fighting against each other. \n\nThe planet map where you have your colonies and sectors to play on is divided into hex fields. One hexfield can be occupied by an army of 6 units. Armies next to each other fight together in battles.\n\nYou can level up your hero on the skirmish or campaign map. It quickly gets very powerful.\n\nIf you like more combat oriented 4x games or wargames in general i would recommend Age of Wonders. Planetfall. It is easy to pick up and fun to play. My first impression of the game is great.

not breathtaking and surely could be better, especially texture resolution and aliasing issues in certain areas (Commander/Hero Model faces for one), but the achieved visual style is very coherent and quite beautiful, at least to my aesthetics.\n\nGameplay will be fairly straightforward to anyone who has ever played any Civilisation game, though with the added twist of additional XCOM-esque turn-based combat, (which outside of tutorial fights can also be resolved automatically if so desired), and HoMM-esque Hero Management and Army Upgrading.\n\nUnlike HoMM however, there aren't just vertical upgrades via replacing one unit type with a better, more evolved unit type that was unlocked through research -- that's just one of the ways to keep your troops ready for anything.\nThe other way is via Mods, and those aren't the (also fully supported) mods for the game itself, but rather ingame modifications you can apply to both your Commmander & Heroes, as well as your rank & file troops.\n\nThese mods can range from simple and straightforward weapons/munitions modifications that give your unit(s) more damage per shot, all the way up to adding additional effects, like Stagger, or even completely new skills & abilities to the modded unit.\nModded units also are automatically turned into a template, thus allowing you to comfortably upgrade all units at once to the same level, and even to build new units in your colony directly with all the most recent mods pre-\"installed\".\n\nAnother major improvement from the most recent Civilisation entry is the fact that -- THANKFULLY -- we are not limited to moving individual units across the map, but are rather able to create and command an entire \"army\", as the game calls it, although a more proper term would probably be multiple platoons rather.\n\nEither way, we can combine up to six units into an individual \"army\", i.e. up to six units can inhabit a single hex tile at the same time, and move in unison.\nThose can either be six regular units, or five of those plus either the one Commander or one of the Heroes.\n\nCombat furthermore is a LOT better than it is with Civilisation as here, when you lay siege to an enemy stronghold with 4 of your armies, you don't just click \"Siege\" and wait turn after turn -- at any given turn, as long as at least one of your besieging armies still has actions left, you can choose to attack the hostile location -- with all your combined power of all those armies you brought into position.\n\nThe same goes for the enemy as well, should they have additional armies of their own in immediate (1 tile) vicinity of the ensuing battle.\n\nLast but not least, your management tools for your Empire to be are also a bit different from what you might be used to with Civilisation games: \n\nInstead of Cities growing their zone of influence (cultural borders) automatically over time, you have to send your armies (or a single unit, if appropriate) to the neighbouring sectors around your Colony (=City) once the latter is ready to annex another one of the former, which in turn depends on how many Citizens are available, and if you can actually feed them at all.\n\nIf you furthermore have enough resources for the annexation itself, simply move your unit(s) into the central sector hex and choose the respective option.\nIf your City currently isn't capable of supporting additional annexed sectors, you can also opt to first simply stake your claim there without actually annexing the entire sector, meaning your zone of control won't be growing to include that area, but you will get sensor and visual coverage, and the forward post will also double as an obstacle for any possible invading hostile forces that they would have to overcome first.\n\nOh, and there's proper Espionage, and of course regular diplomacy.\n\nAll in all, if you love Civilisation, especially the 4th and not so much the newer ones, if you love HoMM and XCOM, this should appeal on all fronts to you -- but mostly you should be able to enjoy games like Civilisation, as that is *by far* the biggest aspect of gameplay here as well.", "timestamp_created": 1565119189, "timestamp_updated": 1565131372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505529344081878662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54489590": {"recommendationid": "54489590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019801689", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 586, "last_played": 1574259668}, "language": "english", "review": "Never played this game before and i played it 10h straight..

There is a lot of good stuff to research between military research and society research, and you get to research both types at the same time. Another awesome new feature that was added in AOW: Planetfall is that you can recruit units while constructing buildings at the same time.

I've only played less than 3 hours at the time of this review, but so far so good!

(Added: Look below for my full review, please!)\n\nHowever, i'm really pleased so far (it's a fun game to me personally)! \nHaving just finished playing the Tutorial (i didn't partake in the beta), it's pretty clear that this game runs deep.. \nAge of Wonders has expanded quite a bit and new players might find it a bit overwhelming at first, luckily the AI will always try to auto-correct the management system (and give advice) in case you would otherwise forget something vital. \nThe game runs amazing and the graphics, music components and whatnot are truly topnotch. The only bugs i've yet encountered are the ones you get to blast, and none of those that would cripple the game in a severe way, so that's by far the best thing i could wish for during launch day!! Kudos Dev Team!! \nNow, it's time to get back into the game and explore....\n\nHey guys, so i've clocked +50 hours and i have a pretty good understanding about how the game works by now.. Truth be told and as expected, it was quite a lot to take in at first (i warned others about it tbh).. The longer i play it, the better you'll get to understand it, that's the advice i'll give to everyone who really likes these games although they don't yet seem so get the hang of things. Believe me, it took me at least 20 hours to stop making stupid & costly mistakes. What i really love about this game is that everything is pretty much connected with each other (actions and consequences etc..Hint: Colony building grids are crucial**) The game runs deep!!\nYou'll always have to make choices, and sometimes you'll need to make them fast too because on higher difficulties the AI really doesn't wait.\nThe research trees 2** of them are, 1* for your colony and an other 1* for your military. They're usually overlapping so you can freely choose/experiment which path to take.. \nThe combat is pretty straightforward.. Passive, defensive, aggressive etc. the game has it all.\nThere are NPC's (minor factions) and they're a really great addition to have, especially when you are able to make them your allies in order to fight an enemy (or more), and at other times they might also be more than a \"simple migraine\" in case they can't be swayed in favour of your cause. \nThere's a whole lot to do within this game and i personally can't wait to see what the upcoming additions and dlcs of this game will have to offer, in the coming months or years.\n\nI personally recommend this game very much!!\nScore: 85/100", "timestamp_created": 1565113982, "timestamp_updated": 1565615825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516237318515777588", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54488380": {"recommendationid": "54488380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191123187", "num_games_owned": 858, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1565113249}, "language": "english", "review": "You can play dinosaurs with lasers?

As someone that hasn\u2019t played an entry in the series since the release of AoW3, I was excited to jump back into it and see what was in store.\n\n[i][b]NOTE:[/b] Had to trim about half of the review to fit Steam char limit, check video for full version![/i]\n\n[i]This is a review of the singleplayer only.[/i]\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list][*][b]Great learning curve.[/b] As with most 4X strategy games, one thing I dread is having to spend hours reading tutorials just to grasp the basics and get rolling. With Planetfall though, I had no such difficulty getting into things. The game provided a tutorial that barely took an hour to complete, but managed to teach me just enough to get going on the campaign immediately afterwards. Within just a few hours, I was flying through combat, managing a bunch of colonies, and maintaining faction relations with ease. It did take longer to fully understand the combat, but I feel like the devs did a good job easing the learning curve overall.\n\n[*][b]Cool province system.[/b] Part of the reason why the game has such a great learning curve is the general lack of micromanagement when it comes to colonies. This is done through the game\u2019s use of a province system, where the entire map is divided up into a random amount of provinces dependent on map size. These provinces can serve as the foundation for a colony, an extension for a colony, or can be made into a smaller forward base.\n\nThe forward bases require no management outside of defending them and the colonies themselves are all managed on one space. There\u2019s no need to place buildings on every space, no need to manage each province individually, and no need to shuffle around workers every turn. Now this may be a con for some, but given the combat-heavy focus of the game, it allowed me to spend more time having fun with the combat.\n\n[*][b]In-depth tactical combat.[/b] On the surface, Planetfall looks just like your everyday 4X strategy game. However, once you get into combat, you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s effectively two games in one. On one side is the 4X strategy, but on the other is the in-depth turn-based tactical combat. I like to describe it as a blend of Civilization and XCOM, with both sides being equally developed and both sides being important to winning the game.\n\nHowever, these two sides are not distinct from each other, they overlap in several key areas. For example, the entire tactical side to the game relies heavily on the unit mods applied to units when outside of battle. A huge chunk of the tech tree is dedicated to these unit mods, which affect everything from damage output, to accuracy, and even add some special abilities like being able to teleport. It was quite cool how both of these sides interacted with each other and the combat was made a lot more complex as a result. It\u2019s the classic \u201ceasy to learn, hard to master\u201d situation.\n\n[*][b]Fun and dynamic quest system.[/b] Although Planetfall does have your standard victory conditions, there are also a variety of quests to take advantage of along the way. If you\u2019re playing a regular scenario outside of the campaign, these usually come from factions. The tasks range from taking down pirate hideouts, to killing a certain number of units from a designated race, to even helping with production and research projects. [i]trimmed...[/i][/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list][*][b]Lackluster AI.[/b] When you\u2019re in the tactical battles, the AI is actually pretty good and absolutely crushed me for the first several hours that I played the game. However, when playing the 4X side to the game, the AI is anything but good. I could not go a single game without running into an AI leaving their units standing still, walking around my own defenseless units, attacking my units in a way that doesn\u2019t benefit them, and even outright ignoring victory conditions.\n\nTo give an example, I was going for the doomsday victory condition as the syndicate, which requires me to build 3 structures in 3 separate colonies and defend them for 10 turns. So upon triggering the countdown, a bunch of factions declared war on me, as they would lose the game otherwise. However, despite having a bunch of factions surrounding me at the time, only a couple of them tried to stop me, and only with a couple unit stacks each. I wasn\u2019t that far ahead military-wise either, so it just came across as odd that all of these factions would just let me win.\n\n[*][b]Disappointing diplomacy mechanics.[/b] As someone that generally likes to take the diplomatic approach in 4X strategy games, I was bit a disappointed with how useless it seemed to be here. My main issue is with how allied factions act when called to war. When forming a defensive pact or alliance, one of the conditions is that both parties be available to go to war if either is attacked. That sounds great in theory, but in practice it practically never happens. That is because the game allows the option to pull out of an alliance or defensive pact whenever either party is called to war.\n\nAs a result, the AI rarely helped me when I had war declared on me. In fact, in all of my time with the game, I only ever had 2 factions come to my aid. 95% of the time they would just shrug off my calls for help and break up the alliance or defensive pact. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just unlucky, but it really made my diplomatic efforts feel like a complete waste if the AI could just dissolve it like that.\n\n[*][b]Unplayable late game.[/b] Unfortunately, Planetfall suffers from the same problem plaguing many other 4X strategy games: that being the very slow load times during the late-game. As I play a lot of these games, I\u2019m used to seeing load times around a minute per turn, but Planetfall easily takes the cake. Once you get up to turn 80 or so on a decently-sized map, the load times can take upwards of several minutes. In fact, on one of the game\u2019s earlier campaign missions, I managed to get past turn 100, where the load times ended up taking around 4-5 minutes to complete every turn. And this is with the game installed on an NVME SSD and running a Ryzen 3700x, so I imagine the situation will be much worse for those with older CPUs and slower hard drives. Most of the games I played finished well before this became a problem, but it was frustrating when I did run into it.\n\n[*][b]Numerous technical issues.[/b] Planetfall also has a bunch of other technical issues. Among these are some more minor ones, like flickering textures and the varying volume of voiced lines. However there are several major ones that I kept running into, including units getting stuck when transitioning to new turns, units getting stuck spinning in circles while in battle, and even some bugs preventing me from progressing in campaign missions. Aside from those issues, I did run into a total of three crashes, although no progress was lost due to the game\u2019s autosave. These are probably issues that are going to be patched with time, but as it stands, they are quite annoying.[/list]\n\n[h1]Overall:[/h1]\nPlanetfall is a decent strategy game overall. The combat is fun, the province system is great, and the quest system is pretty cool. However, the game is brought down by its lackluster AI, disappointing diplomacy mechanics, and numerous technical issues. It may be worth waiting for a few patches to fix up those technical issues first, but in its current state, the game is at least still fun.\n\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews + videos!", "timestamp_created": 1565107265, "timestamp_updated": 1565115205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 520, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.806532084941864014", "comment_count": 36, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "92084243": {"recommendationid": "92084243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030854100", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 16211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16211, "last_played": 1574593253}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot speak about the multi-player, but the single player experience is really not that great.

I love the art style, the way the map is divided into different areas. It's got a pretty good progression system and a nice XCOM-like combat.

They are all super different, sometimes (very often, actually), you can just win by doing some quick and simple stuff. And some games last very long. Most of the Victory conditions are just lame. Ultimately, it made me quit the game, the victory conditions just got very boring really quick. One day I just didn't feel like playing anymore and now i just don't want to come back. \n\nStill, a decent game to grab on a discount, if you are searching for some strategy game to spend a few days on, or may be more.

Might and Magic or Age of Wonders, in space, with solid turn based combat. Hero and unit customization is a fantastic touch too with many upgrades and skills to learn for each unit. \n\nThe maps are decently sized, but I wish that focusing more on diplomacy/economy was a viable option like many other 4x games. You have to fight in this game. \n\nMust have for 4x strategy fans who like faster paced games. \n\nThe biggest complaint I have is that there are some poor UI design choices, but nothing that kills the game. The game has A TON of different status effects and unit modifies. During combat it is very difficult to tell what unit is effected by what, or what abilities they have unless you open their unit panel which can be a pain for large battles. If I could hover over a unit and see a little window of the statuses on the edge of the screen or something that would be a HUGE help. Same with which units have taken their turn and which units have yet to complete their turn in tactical combat. Unit turn order is a big deal when deciding how you want to buff/move your units... small fights of 1v1 armies it's manageable but once you have 18 armies on the board you really need some sort of helpful tool to help you manage the turns otherwise you make moves out of order and end up kicking yourself. \n\nThe best feature of the game is the auto-resolve combat. Yes yes, it is just as bad as every other 4x out there, sometimes telling you that you lost your commander or something to a pathetic enemy.... instead of making you reload the previous save if something silly happens, it lets you wipe clean the result and enter tactical combat. It is a HUGE time saver for someone like me who is almost always going in to handle combat myself in these sorts of games because I don't want to have some absurd result force me to reload. \n\nVery little negative to say.
